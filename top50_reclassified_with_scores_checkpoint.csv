Oxygenated Transport Fuels from Carbon Dioxide,"The restructuring of the economy post-COVID-19 coupled to the drive towards Net Zero carbon dioxide emissions means we must rethink the way we use transport fuels. Fossil-carbon based fuels are ubiquitous in the transport sector, however there are alternative synthetic fuels that could be used as drop-in or replacement fuels. The main hurdles to achieving a transition to synthetic fuels are the limited availability of low-cost carbon dioxide at an appropriate purity, the availability of renewable hydrogen and, in the case of hydrocarbons, catalysts that are selective for small and particular chain lengths. In this paper we will consider some of the alternative fuels and methods that could reduce cost, both economically and environmentally. We recommend that increased effort in the rapid development of these fuels should be a priority in order to accelerate the possibility of achieving Net Zero without costly infrastructure changes. As ground transportation offers a more straightforward approach legislatively, we will look at oxygenated organic fuels as an alternative drop-in replacement for hydrocarbons.",4,1,1,1,5,3,7,9,8,6

Synthesis of β-alkoxy-<i>N</i>-protected phenethylamines <i>via</i> one-pot copper-catalyzed aziridination and ring opening,"A regioselective, copper-catalyzed, one-pot aminoalkoxylation of styrenes using primary and secondary alcohols and three different iminoiodanes as alkoxy and nitrogen sources respectively, is reported. The β-alkoxy-N-protected phenethylamines obtained were used to synthesise β-alkoxy-N-benzylphenethylamines which are interesting new compounds that could act as possible neuronal ligands.",5,5,4,1,3,2,3,0,3,5
High‐yield controlled syntheses of polysilanes by the Wurtz‐type reductive coupling reaction,"Abstract The factors that determine the Wurtz‐type reductive coupling of dichloroorganosilanes by alkali metals are reviewed. A strong recommendation is advanced for carrying out all such polysilane syntheses in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature, conditions under which the reaction gives far higher yields and generally much narrower product molecular weight distributions. The higher yields are attributed to the ability of the solvent to sequester the sodium ion and thereby stabilize the anionic chain carriers. The bimodal molecular weight distributions of the product polymers, which are ubiquitous when such reactions are carried out in high‐boiling‐point aromatic solvents under reflux, as is common practice, are attributed to it being a defect‐diffusion‐controlled polymerization at the alkali metal surface. The narrower molecular weight distributions that result from syntheses in tetrahydrofuran are attributed to the suppression of defect diffusion rates at lower temperatures.

Regio‐ and Enantio‐selective Chemo‐enzymatic C−H‐Lactonization of Decanoic Acid to (<i>S</i>)‐δ‐Decalactone,"Abstract The conversion of saturated fatty acids to high value chiral hydroxy‐acids and lactones poses a number of synthetic challenges: the activation of unreactive C−H bonds and the need for regio‐ and stereoselectivity. Here the first example of a wild‐type cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP116B46 from Tepidiphilus thermophilus) capable of enantio‐ and regioselective C5 hydroxylation of decanoic acid 1 to ( S )‐5‐hydroxydecanoic acid 2 is reported. Subsequent lactonization yields ( S )‐δ‐decalactone 3 , a high value fragrance compound, with greater than 90 % ee . Docking studies provide a rationale for the high regio‐ and enantioselectivity of the reaction.",0,3,4,1,3,3,6,2,5,7
A Comparative Investigation on Various Platinum Nanoparticles Decorated Carbon Supports for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"Background: Fuel cells have a very low emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2, SOx etc with high efficiencies and are non-polluting energy sources. One of the current challenges is to develop inexpensive and efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) materials. Extensive research has been conducted to develop platinum (Pt) loaded carbon nanomaterials for ORR applications. However, the literature is rife with inconsistencies owing to varying synthesis conditions of Pt nanoparticles, variation of carbon supports materials and indeed the ORR experiments.

Organometallic hydrogen transfer and dehydrogenationcatalysts for the conversion of bio-renewable alcohols,"Organometallic hydrogen transfer and dehydrogenation provide straightforward atom efficient routes from alcohols to a variety of chemical products.

"Graphene/nano-porous silicon and graphene/bimetallic silicon nanostructures (Pt–M, M: Pd, Ru, Rh), efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction","In this work nano-porous silicon flour (Nano-PSiF) was synthesized first and then there was an investigation into its electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results showed that Nano-PSiF has good electrocatalytic activity for the HER when compared with PSiF. In the second section, Pt and Pt-M (M = Pd, Rh, Ru) bimetallic silicon nanostructures were prepared by a direct reduction of the metal (Pt, Pt-Pd, Pt-Rh and Pt-Ru) on the surface of the PSiF by a galvanic exchange mechanism. The electrocatalytic activity of the bimetallic silicon nanostructures (Pt-M/PSiF) were evaluated for the HER. The results showed that all of the Pt-M/PSiFs have excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER in a 0.5 mol L(-1) H2SO4 solution. For the Pt/PSiF, the Tafel slope of Pt/PSiF was 46.9 mV dec(-1), indicating its excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER and it is comparable with commercial Pt/C. On the other hand, the bimetallic silicon nanostructures showed better electrocatalytic activity than Pt/PSiF for the HER (lower Tafel slope, and higher α). Finally, exfoliated graphene oxide was electro-deposited on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (eRGO/GCE) and used as a sub-layer for the Pt-M/PSiF. Then, the electrocatalytic activities of the bimetallic silicon nanostructures on the eRGO/GCE were investigated for the HER. The results showed that there was a higher electrocatalytic activity for Pt-M/PSiF-eRGO/GCE when compared with Pt-M/PSiF-GCE.",1,6,4,1,3,3,6,8,7,5
Fluorogenic Biosensors Constructed via Aggregation-induced Emission Based on Enzyme-catalyzed Coupling Reactions for Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a main reactive oxygen by-product produced in the metabolism of organisms and a common biomarker of oxidative stress. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probes for H2O2 have been proposed. Such AIEgens mostly use benzeneboronic acid as a recognition group. Recently, a strategy involving enzyme-catalyzed polymerization of AIE compounds shows great potential in AIEgens design. We herein modify the AIE motif, tetraphenylethene (TPE) with o-phenylenediamine (TPE-TAF), which can be oxidated by H2O2 in HRP to form an intramolecular phenazine structure. Compared with a similar approach, the proposed strategy is simple and the TPE-TAF showed a sensitive ""turn-on"" fluorescence with H2O2. The detection limit (LOD) is 3.39 μM and the probe is highly specific against H2O2. We further verified the reaction mechanism of the enzyme-catalyzed coupling reaction. The probe is a promising candidate as a stable and safe fluorescent substrate in H2O2 sensing.",0,3,4,1,3,3,5,2,4,6

"2,5-Diketopiperazines as Potent, Selective, and Orally Bioavailable Oxytocin Antagonists. 2. Synthesis, Chirality, and Pharmacokinetics","A short stereoselective synthesis of a series of chiral 7-aryl-2,5-diketopiperazines oxytocin antagonists is described. Varying the functionality and substitution pattern of substituents in the 7-aryl ring and varying the chirality of this exocyclic ring have produced potent oxytocin antagonists (pK(i) > 8.5). SAR and pharmacokinetic profiling of this series of (3R,6R,7R)-2,5-diketopiperazines together with the introduction of an ortho F group in the 7-aryl ring to improve rat pK has culminated in the 2',4'-difluorophenyldiketopiperazine derivative 37, a highly potent oxytocin antagonist against the human oxytocin receptor (pK(i) = 8.9) that has >1000-fold selectivity over all three vasopressin receptors V1a, V2, and V1b. It has good bioavailability (46%) in the rat and moderate bioavailability (13-31%) in the dog and is more active in vivo in the rat than atosiban (rat DR(10) = 0.44 mg/kg iv).",4,3,4,1,3,3,7,0,6,5
Cell-permeable lanthanide–platinum(<scp>iv</scp>) anti-cancer prodrugs,"Platinum compounds are a vital part of our anti-cancer arsenal, and determining the location and speciation of platinum compounds is crucial. We have synthesised a lanthanide complex bearing a salicylic group (Ln = Gd, Eu) which demonstrates excellent cellular accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity. Derivatisation enabled access to bimetallic lanthanide-platinum(ii) and lanthanide-platinum(iv) complexes. Luminescence from the europium-platinum(iv) system was quenched, and reduction to platinum(ii) with ascorbic acid resulted in a ""switch-on"" luminescence enhancement. We used diffusion-based 1H NMR spectroscopic methods to quantify cellular accumulation. The gadolinium-platinum(ii) and gadolinium-platinum(iv) complexes demonstrated appreciable cytotoxicity. A longer delay following incubation before cytotoxicity was observed for the gadolinium-platinum(iv) compared to the gadolinium-platinum(ii) complex. Functionalisation with octanoate ligands resulted in enhanced cellular accumulation and an even greater latency in cytotoxicity.",4,5,4,1,3,3,5,0,6,4
Transition-Metal-Catalyzed C(sp3)–H Alkylation of Methyl Heteroarenes with Alcohols,"Transition-metal-catalyzed C(sp3)-H bond functionalization is a useful transformation for the construction of C–C bonds. A versatile and easy-to-perform protocol in this respect is the C-alkylation of methyl heteroarenes with alcohols using auto-transfer hydrogenative (ATH) reactions. Various transition metal catalysts based on Ir, Pt, Ru, Ni, Co, Fe and Mn have been employed for the construction of chain-elongated alkyl-substituted heterocyclic compounds using this chemistry. Water is the only byproduct and the starting alcohols are less toxic, readily available, more easily handled and more atom-economical substrates than their halogen counterparts. This review details recent advances in this synthetic methodology, describing the scope, reaction mechanism, chemo-selectivity and applications.",3,5,4,1,3,3,5,4,6,5

Creating Accessible Active Sites in Hierarchical MFI Zeolites for Low‐Temperature Acid Catalysis,"Abstract A versatile desilication design strategy for the creation of hierarchical H–ZSM‐5 zeolite catalysts with different Si/Al ratios has been demonstrated. The nature, strength, and the accessibility of the acid sites after the alkaline treatment was elucidated by employing a range of physico‐chemical characterization tools; notably probe‐based FTIR spectroscopy along with Solid State (SS) MAS NMR spectroscopy. In addition, structural and textural properties of the hierarchical zeolites were also explored and compared to their corresponding microporous analogues. CO was used to probe the acidic properties of the hierarchical zeolites with the concomitant deployment of a bulky molecular probe, 2,4,6‐trimethylpyridine (collidine), which is too large to access the micropores, to specifically investigate the enhanced accessibility of the active sites. The hierarchical zeolites were evaluated in the industrially relevant, acid‐catalyzed Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanoneoxime to ϵ ‐caprolactam, the precursor for Nylon‐6, in liquid phase and at low temperatures. The catalytic findings with the hierarchical catalysts reveal a significant enhancement in the production of ϵ ‐caprolactam, compared with the parent microporous H–ZSM‐5 zeolite, thereby highlighting the merits of our design approach in facilitating enhanced diffusion and mass transfer.",2,1,4,1,3,3,6,4,5,6
Coupling Nonthermal Plasma with V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanofiber Catalysts for Enhanced Oxidation of Ethyl Acetate,"Plasma-catalytic oxidation of ethyl acetate was conducted in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. The effect of novel nanofiber catalysts (nano-V5Ti and nano-TiO2) and corresponding bulk catalysts on the plasma-catalytic process was investigated and compared with using plasma alone. The combination of plasma and nano-V5Ti catalyst significantly showed the best plasma-catalytic oxidation performance. Catalyst characterization showed that nano-V5Ti possessed smaller crystalline size and higher relative concentration of surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species compared to the bulk catalysts, which played a key role in the enhanced oxidation of ethyl acetate and its intermediates on the catalyst surfaces. Compared to the bulk catalysts, the formation of more reduced vanadium species (V4+) in the nano-V5Ti catalysts indicated the presence of more oxygen vacancies on the nano-V5Ti surface, which in turn improved the reducibility of nano-V5Ti and facilitated surface oxygen species activation in the plasma region and contributed to the plasma-catalytic oxidation reactions.",2,6,4,1,3,3,5,7,6,6
Pd/ZnO catalysts for direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol,"The direct hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol is crucial for providing a means of CO2 fixation and a way to store cleanly produced hydrogen in a more energy-dense and transportable form. Here we have prepared two series of Pd/ZnO catalysts, both by immobilisation of PVA-protected Pd colloids and by Pd impregnation of PdCl2 to investigate structure activity relationships for direct CO2 hydrogenation. Very different performances were found for the different preparation methods, and the Pd loading and pre-reduction of the catalysts were shown to be important factors for optimising methanol yield. The crucial factor for high methanol yield is the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy, either during the reaction itself, or better by high temperature pre-reduction. The formation of the alloy greatly reduces CO production by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalysts prepared by sol-immobilisation were relatively stable to thermal treatment. In contrast, the impregnated catalysts were much less thermally stable, due to the presence of remnant chloride on the surface of the catalyst, which was absent for the case of sol immobilisation preparation. The results illustrate the importance of controlling the PdZn particle size and its surface structure for the catalysts to achieve high methanol selectivity (60%, the rest being CO) and conversion (11%) at 250 °C and 20 bar. Selectivity for sol-immobilised catalysts decreases from 60% at 3 nm average diameter, to 20% at 7 nm.",2,2,4,1,3,3,6,8,7,5

Assessing carbon monoxide poisoning,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas usually formed during the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels. Poisoning by CO can be fatal or lead to long-term debilitating cardiovascular, respiratory and neuropsychological conditions. Despite the reinforcement of government policies on CO poisoning over the past decade, emergency practitioners should become more aware of CO toxicity to reduce mortality and morbidity, and an unnecessary financial burden on health services. This article alerts emergency nurses to the signs and symptoms of CO poisoning and discusses the use of non-invasive CO-monitoring devices to confirm levels of CO in patients' blood and exhaled air. It also considers the case for early CO monitoring in emergency care settings.",4,5,4,1,3,4,5,2,6,4
Synthesis and Characterization of Vanadyl Hydrogen Phosphite Hydrate,"A novel method for the preparation of vanadyl hydrogen phosphite hydrates is described. The reaction of V2O5, H3PO3, and 1-propanol in the absence of water at 150 °C led to the formation of VOHPO3·1.5H2O with high surface area (ca. 50 m2/g), whereas in the presence of water VOHPO3·H2O was the unique product. The materials were characterized using a combination of techniques including elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, laser Raman spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. On heating the sample in flowing nitrogen at 750 °C, it was found that the vanadyl(IV) hydrogen phosphite(III) hydrates transformed into vanadium(III) phosphate(V), VPO4, via an internal oxidation−reduction process between V(IV) and P(III), wherein V(IV) was reduced to V(III) and P(III) was oxidized to P(V). Whereas, heating the vanadyl hydrogen phosphite hydrates in flowing hydrogen can inhibit the phase transformation from vanadyl hydrogen phosphite to VPO4. The catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride using the final catalysts prepared by in situ activation under the reaction conditions was contrasted. It was found that the catalyst derived from the VOHPO3·H2O precursor shows a higher intrinsic activity for the production of maleic anhydride than that derived from VOHPO3·1.5H2O.",2,6,4,1,3,3,5,4,6,7
"Bioinspired, Multidisciplinary, Iterative Catalyst Design Creates the Highest Performance Peroxidase Mimics and the Field of Sustainable Ultradilute Oxidation Catalysis (SUDOC)","Oxidation catalysts called NewTAMLs, macrocyclic complexes with TAML carbonamido-N donors replaced by more nucleophile-resistant binders, sulfonamido-N, for example, [Fe{4-NO2C6H3-1,2-(NCOCMe2NSO2)2CHMe}]− (5d), deliver record-setting technical performance parameters (TPPs) for functional peroxidase mimicry. NewTAMLs were designed to test the previously discounted hypothesis that nucleophilic decay of carbonamido-N iron chelators is TAML catalyst lifetime-limiting and, for precautionary reasons, to escape fluorine in the best-performing TAML (1c) for catalyzing ultradilute water purification by H2O2. Replacing two of four TAML carbonamides with less σ-donating sulfonamides in 5 was found to more than compensate for eliminating 1c's F-substituents to increase substrate oxidation rates and, following the discovery and parametrization of an additional decomposition mechanism, to alter catalyst degradation rates protectively. At pH 7 in less than 5 min, the best-performing NewTAML 5d activates H2O2 to eliminate the β-blocker drug and sentinel micropollutant (MP) propranolol to the limit of UPLC detection under very dilute starting conditions that pass through the ultradilute regime (≤2 ppb): [5d] = 100 nM (∼60 ppb), [propranolol] = 53 nM (15.6 ppb), [H2O2] = 330 μM (11.2 ppm). This is ca. 10 times faster than 1c/H2O2 under comparable conditions giving an important advance in the real-world potential for time-, concentration-, and cost-sensitive MP water treatments. The separate decomposition mechanism involves carbon acids bridging the two sulfonamides, a discovery that expands design control over operating NewTAML lifetimes—these features we have named ""kill switches"" are analyzed for impacts on catalytic function, process control, and sustainable design. Mouse uterotrophic assays show no low-dose adverse effects (lodafs) for the prototype NewTAML (5a) or for the process solution from the 5a/H2O2 destruction of the contraceptive pill estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (EE2), a potent MP. The multidisciplinary catalyst design protocol that led to NewTAMLs is presented graphically to highlight how five key sustainability performances—technical, cost, health, environmental, fairness—are being optimized together for sustainable oxidation catalysis and water treatment. The results validate the ""bioinspired"" descriptor and the name sustainable ultradilute oxidation catalysis (SUDOC) for this emerging field while highlighting to chemists that dealing with the lodafs and locafs (low-concentration adverse effects) of everyday–everywhere chemicals is essential for sustainability.",0,3,4,1,3,4,7,8,8,6
Hybrid photothermal-photocatalyst sheets for solar-driven overall water splitting coupled to clean water production from seawater and waste streams,"Photocatalytic water splitting converts sunlight directly into storable hydrogen, but involves commonly pure water, installation on land and production of unusable waste heat. Here, we report a hybrid device consisting of a photocatalyst (PC) and a solar vapour generator (SVG) for simultaneous overall water splitting and water purification from open water sources. Specifically, a UV light absorbing RhCrOx-Al:SrTiO3 photocatalyst is deposited on top of a floating, visible and infrared light absorbing porous carbon SVG, which produces green fuel with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 0.14±0.02% coupled to 0.95 kg m−2 h−1 of water vapour as a substrate for the PC and collectable purified water. This integrated system maintains operational stability in seawater and other aqueous waste streams for over 154 hours due to the isolation of the PC from the contaminants in the liquid feedstock. This work provides a new concept for developing an off-grid energy production-storage solution and is a first step towards alleviating both energy and water supply challenges.",6,6,4,1,3,4,6,9,8,7
Condensation of Indole with Isatin over AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Mesoporous Aluminosilicate,"Aluminium chloride immobilized on mesoporous aluminosilicate was investigated as catalysts in the condensation of isatin with indole. AlCl3/mesoporous aluminosilicate (AlCl3/AM) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of 1, 5, 10 and 15 wt% AlCl3 on the surface of mesoporous aluminosilicate. A maximum conversion of isatin was achieved using 15% AlCl3/AM catalyst whereas the highest selectivity of 68.97% towards trisindoline was obtained using pure AM. The activity of the catalysts was depended on their acid site number and surface area. The number of Brønsted acid and the surface area affected to the conversion of isatin while the total acidity and the number of Lewis acid influenced the selectivity.",2,1,4,1,3,3,4,2,3,5
Copper‐Mediated <i>N</i>‐Trifluoromethylation of <i>O</i>‐Benzoylhydroxylamines,"Abstract The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C −CF 3 and O −CF 3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N −CF 3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N ‐trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper‐catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N −CF 3 containing compounds.",3,5,4,1,3,3,5,1,4,7
Optofluidic Photonic Crystal Fiber Microreactors for In Situ Studies of Carbon Nanodot-Driven Photoreduction,"Performing quantitative in situ spectroscopic analysis on minuscule sample volumes is a common difficulty in photochemistry. To address this challenge, we use a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) that guides light at the center of a microscale liquid channel and acts as an optofluidic microreactor with a reaction volume of less than 35 nL. The system was used to demonstrate in situ optical detection of photoreduction processes that are key components of many photocatalytic reaction schemes. The photoreduction of viologens (XV2+) to the radical XV•+ in a homogeneous mixture with carbon nanodot (CND) light absorbers is studied for a range of different carbon dots and viologens. Time-resolved absorption spectra, measured over several UV irradiation cycles, are interpreted with a quantitative kinetic model to determine photoreduction and photobleaching rate constants. The powerful combination of time-resolved, low-volume absorption spectroscopy and kinetic modeling highlights the potential of optofluidic microreactors as a highly sensitive, quantitative, and rapid screening platform for novel photocatalysts and flow chemistry in general.",6,6,4,1,3,3,5,6,7,6
Simultaneous hypercrosslinking and functionalization of polyHIPEs for use as coarse powder catalyst supports,"Porous polymers offer desirable properties for heterogeneous catalysis, such as excellent stability, high active site density, and reusability. However, their synthesis is often complicated, requiring expensive reagents and laborious synthetic processes. We produce organophosphorus functionalized polyHIPEs by the polymerization of particle and surfactant stabilized water-in-styrene/divinylbenzene high internal phase emulsion templates, followed by post-functionalization using low-cost hypercrosslinking strategies. Three hypercrosslinking approaches were investigated, including knitting with an external crosslinker, solvent stitching and Scholl coupling reaction. Each approach's ability to simultaneously create micro/mesoporosity and incorporate organophosphorus moieties into the polyHIPE structure as catalyst anchor sites were assessed, introducing surface areas of up to 410 m2/g and phosphorus concentrations of up to 7.4 wt%. After Pd-loading, the polyHIPEs displayed outstanding catalytic performance in a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, reaching turnover frequencies of 5722 h−1. The coarse powder form of the polyHIPEs allowed for simple catalyst recovery from the reaction mixture for reuse.",2,5,4,1,3,4,6,5,7,6
Site-Selective C-C Modification of Proteins at Neutral pH Using Organocatalyst-Mediated Cross Aldol Ligations,"The bioconjugation of proteins with small molecules has proved an invaluable strategy for probing and perturbing dynamic biological mechanisms. The general use of chemical methods for the functionalisation of proteins remains limited however by the frequent requirement for complicated reaction partners to be present in large excess, and harsh reaction conditions which are incompatible with many protein scaffolds. Herein we describe a site-selective organocatalyst-mediated protein aldol ligation (OPAL) that affords stable carbon-carbon linked bioconjugates at neutral pH under biocompatible conditions. OPAL enables rapid chemical modification of proteins within an hour using simple aldehyde probes in minimal excess, and is utilised here in the selective affinity tagging of proteins in cell lysate. Furthermore we demonstrate that the b-hydroxy aldehyde product of the OPAL can be functionalised a second time at neutral pH in a subsequent organocatalyst-mediated oxime ligation. This tandem strategy is showcased in the ‘chemical mimicry’ of a previously inaccessible natural dual post-translationally modified protein integral to the pathogenesis of the neglected tropical disease Leishmaniasis. &lt;br&gt;",0,3,4,1,3,3,5,0,6,7

Guest Encapsulation Within Surface-Adsorbed Self-Assembled Cages,"Coordination cages encapsulate a wide variety of guests in the solution state. This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. Here we report a simple and general method for the immobilisation of coordination cages on alumina. Cage loadings were quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrated that the adsorbed cages retained the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non-guest molecules. Finally, we used a system of two cages adsorbed on to different regions of alumina to stabilise and separate a pair of Diels-Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest resulted in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. We envisage this method of coordination cage immobilisation on solid phases to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid-phase molecular encapsulation.",2,5,4,1,3,3,5,2,4,6

Visible-Light-Active BiOI/TiO<sub>2</sub> Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Remediation of Crude Oil-Contaminated Water,"In this study, BiOI-sensitized TiO2 (BiOI/TiO2) nanocomposites with different levels of BiOI deposited via sequential ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) have been explored for the degradation of methyl orange, 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), and crude oil in water under visible (>400 nm) irradiation with excellent degradation performance. The reaction progress for methyl orange and 4-chlorophenol was monitored by a UV-vis spectrophotometer, and the degradation of the crude oil hydrocarbons was determined by GC-MS. The BiOI/TiO2 heterojunction improves separation of photogenerated charges, which enhances the degradation efficiency. Evaluation of the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts against methyl orange degradation confirmed that four SILAR cycles are the optimal deposition condition for the best degradation efficiency. The efficiency was further confirmed by degrading 4-CP and crude oil, achieving 38.30 and 85.62% degradation, respectively, compared with 0.0% (4-CP) and 70.56% (crude oil) achieved by TiO2. The efficiency of TiO2 in degrading crude oil was mainly due to adsorption along with photolysis. This study provides a simple and cost-effective alternative to traditional remediation methods requiring high energy consumption for remediation of crude oil-polluted water and refinery wastewater using visible-light photocatalysis along with adsorption.",6,6,4,1,3,3,6,8,7,5

"Predicting Regioselectivity of AO, CYP, FMO, and UGT Metabolism Using Quantum Mechanical Simulations and Machine Learning","Unexpected metabolism in modification and conjugation phases can lead to the failure of many late-stage drug candidates or even withdrawal of approved drugs. Thus, it is critical to predict the sites of metabolism (SoM) for enzymes, which interact with drug-like molecules, in the early stages of the research. This study presents methods for predicting the isoform-specific metabolism for human AOs, FMOs, and UGTs and general CYP metabolism for preclinical species. The models use semi-empirical quantum mechanical simulations, validated using experimentally obtained data and DFT calculations, to estimate the reactivity of each SoM in the context of the whole molecule. Ligand-based models, trained and tested using high-quality regioselectivity data, combine the reactivity of the potential SoM with the orientation and steric effects of the binding pockets of the different enzyme isoforms. The resulting models achieve κ values of up to 0.94 and AUC of up to 0.92.",0,3,4,1,3,3,6,0,7,4
Oxygen-deficient photostable Cu<sub>2</sub>O for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity,"Oxygen vacancies in inorganic semiconductors play an important role in reducing electron-hole recombination, which may have important implications in photocatalysis. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O), a visible light active p-type semiconductor, is a promising photocatalyst. However, the synthesis of photostable Cu2O enriched with oxygen defects remains a challenge. We report a simple method for the gram-scale synthesis of highly photostable Cu2O nanoparticles by the hydrolysis of a Cu(i)-triethylamine [Cu(i)-TEA] complex at low temperature. The oxygen vacancies in these Cu2O nanoparticles led to a significant increase in the lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers upon excitation with visible light. This, in combination with a suitable energy band structure, allowed Cu2O nanoparticles to exhibit outstanding photoactivity in visible light through the generation of electron-mediated hydroxyl (OH˙) radicals. This study highlights the significance of oxygen defects in enhancing the photocatalytic performance of promising semiconductor photocatalysts.",6,6,4,1,3,3,5,7,6,4
Investigation of polyacrylamide hydrogel‐based molecularly imprinted polymers using protein gel electrophoresis,"Abstract In conjunction with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), molecular imprinting methods have been applied to produce a multilayer mini‐slab in order to evaluate how selectively and specifically a hydrogel‐based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) binds bovine haemoglobin (BHb, ~64.5 kDa). A three‐layer mini‐slab comprising an upper and lower layer and a MIP, or a non‐imprinted control polymer dispersion middle layer has been investigated. The discriminating MIP layer, also based on polyacrylamide, was able to specifically bind BHb molecules in preference to a protein similar in molecular weight such as bovine serum albumin (BSA, ~66 kDa). Protein staining allowed us to visualise the protein retention strength of the MIP layer under the influence of an electric field. This method could be applied to other proteins with implications in effective protein capture, disease diagnostics, and protein analysis.",0,3,4,1,3,3,4,1,5,6
Evolution before genes,"Our current understanding of evolution is so tightly linked to template-dependent replication of DNA and RNA molecules that the old idea from Oparin of a self-reproducing 'garbage bag' ('coacervate') of chemicals that predated fully-fledged cell-like entities seems to be farfetched to most scientists today. However, this is exactly the kind of scheme we propose for how Darwinian evolution could have occurred prior to template replication.We cannot confirm previous claims that autocatalytic sets of organic polymer molecules could undergo evolution in any interesting sense by themselves. While we and others have previously imagined inhibition would result in selectability, we found that it produced multiple attractors in an autocatalytic set that cannot be selected for. Instead, we discovered that if general conditions are satisfied, the accumulation of adaptations in chemical reaction networks can occur. These conditions are the existence of rare reactions producing viable cores (analogous to a genotype), that sustains a molecular periphery (analogous to a phenotype).We conclude that only when a chemical reaction network consists of many such viable cores, can it be evolvable. When many cores are enclosed in a compartment there is competition between cores within the same compartment, and when there are many compartments, there is between-compartment competition due to the phenotypic effects of cores and their periphery at the compartment level. Acquisition of cores by rare chemical events, and loss of cores at division, allows macromutation, limited heredity and selectability, thus explaining how a poor man's natural selection could have operated prior to genetic templates. This is the only demonstration to date of a mechanism by which pre-template accumulation of adaptation could occur.",0,3,4,1,3,1,0,0,3,7
Preparation of Polyfunctional Arylzinc Organometallics in Toluene by Halogen/Zinc Exchange Reactions,"A wide range of polyfunctional diaryl- and diheteroarylzinc species were prepared in toluene within 10 min to 5 h through an I/Zn or Br/Zn exchange reaction using bimetallic reagents of the general formula R'2 Zn⋅2 LiOR (R'=sBu, tBu, pTol). Highly sensitive functional groups, such as a triazine, a ketone, an aldehyde, or a nitro group, were tolerated in these exchange reactions, enabling the synthesis of a plethora of functionalized (hetero)arenes after quenching with various electrophiles. Insight into the constitution and reactivity of these bimetallic mixtures revealed the formation of highly active lithium diorganodialkoxyzincates of type [R'2 Zn(OR)2 Li2 ].",3,5,4,1,3,3,4,2,3,5
Insights into <i>E. coli</i> Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Synthase (CFAS) Towards Enantioselective Carbene Free Biocatalytic Cyclopropanation.,"Abstract Cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (CFAS) are a class of S ‐adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase enzymes able to catalyse the cyclopropanation of unsaturated phospholipids. Since CFAS enzymes employ SAM as a methylene source to cyclopropanate alkene substrates, they have the potential to be mild and more sustainable biocatalysts for cyclopropanation transformations than current carbene‐based approaches. This work describes the characterisation of E. coli CFAS ( ec CFAS) and its exploitation in the stereoselective biocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropyl lipids. ec CFAS was found to convert phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to methyl dihydrosterculate 1 with up to 58 % conversion and 73 % ee and the absolute configuration (9S,10R) was established. Substrate tolerance of ec CFAS was found to be correlated with the electronic properties of phospholipid headgroups and for the first time ec CFAS was found to catalyse cyclopropanation of both phospholipid chains to form dicyclopropanated products. In addition, mutagenesis and in silico experiments were carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis and to provide structural insights into the lipid substrate preference of ec CFAS. Finally, the biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate 1 and its deuterated analogue was also accomplished combining recombinant ec CFAS with the SAM regenerating At HMT enzyme in the presence of CH 3 I and CD 3 I respectively.",0,3,4,1,3,3,5,4,6,7

From THF an ortho-lithiated dimer is isolated but from N,N,N′,N′′,N′′pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (pmdeta) a laterally lithiated monomer is obtained (see scheme). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations point to the importance of Lewis base solvation and aggregation state in determining the chemoselectivity.

A 3D-Printed Standardized Modular Microfluidic System for Droplet Generation,"Droplet-based microfluidics has a variety of applications, such as material synthesis and single-cell analysis. In this paper, we propose a modular microfluidic system using projection micro-stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing technology for droplet generation. All modules are designed using a standard cubic structure with a specific leakage-free connection interface. Versatile droplets, including single droplets, alternating droplets, merged droplets, and Janus particles, have been successfully produced. The droplet size and the generation rate can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the flow rates. The influence of the flow rate fraction between the discrete phase and the continuous phase over the generation of the alternating and merged droplets is discussed. Furthermore, the 'UV curing' module can be employed to solidify the generated droplets to avoid coalescence and fix the status of the Janus particles. The proposed modular droplet generators are promising candidates for various chemical and biological applications, such as single-cell incubation, screening of protein crystallization conditions, synthesis of nanoparticles, and gene delivery. In addition, we envision that more functional modules, e.g., valve, microreactor, and detection modules, could be developed, and the 3D standardized modular microfluidics could be further applied to other complex systems, i.e., concentration gradient generators and clinical diagnostic systems.",4,3,4,1,3,3,7,2,6,5

"Catalytic 1,4‐Rhodium(III) Migration Enables 1,3‐Enynes to Function as One‐Carbon Oxidative Annulation Partners in CH Functionalizations","Abstract 1,3‐Enynes containing allylic hydrogens cis to the alkyne are shown to act as one‐carbon partners, rather than two‐carbon partners, in various rhodium‐catalyzed oxidative annulations. The mechanism of these unexpected transformations is proposed to occur through double CH activation, involving a hitherto rare example of the 1,4‐migration of a Rh III species. This phenomenon is general across a variety of substrates, and provides a diverse range of heterocyclic products.",3,5,4,1,3,2,3,1,4,6

Rapid Production of High‐Purity Hydrogen Fuel through Microwave‐Promoted Deep Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Liquid Alkanes with Abundant Metals,"Abstract Hydrogen as an energy carrier promises a sustainable energy revolution. However, one of the greatest challenges for any future hydrogen economy is the necessity for large scale hydrogen production not involving concurrent CO 2 production. The high intrinsic hydrogen content of liquid‐range alkane hydrocarbons (including diesel) offers a potential route to CO 2 ‐free hydrogen production through their catalytic deep dehydrogenation. We report here a means of rapidly liberating high‐purity hydrogen by microwave‐promoted catalytic dehydrogenation of liquid alkanes using Fe and Ni particles supported on silicon carbide. A H 2 production selectivity from all evolved gases of some 98 %, is achieved with less than a fraction of a percent of adventitious CO and CO 2 . The major co‐product is solid, elemental carbon.",2,5,4,1,3,3,7,9,8,6
