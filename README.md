**Project ALMA - Advancing Climate Solutions using Language Model-based Analysis**

Alma ("Soul" in Spanish) leverages language models to analyse extensive climate research. ALMA tackles large volumes of academic and technical literature and evaluates which ones are climate related and could potentially be commercialisable solutions. By highlighting practical, and neglected fields, it helps translate knowledge from scientific literature into meaningful climate solutions.

This project is led by Climate Solutions Catalyst of Undaunted (https://undaunted-hq.org/), part of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/), and funded by the Quadrature Climate Foundation (https://www.qc.foundation/)
