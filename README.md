Project ALMA - Advancing Climate Solutions using Language Model-based Analysis

Alma ("Soul" in Spanish) leverages language models to analyse extensive climate research. ALMA distills large volumes of academic and technical literature into actionable insights. By highlighting practical, yet often overlooked strategies, it helps translate scientific knowledge into meaningful progress on climate challenges.
This project is led by Undaunted (https://undaunted-hq.org/), part of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/), and funded by the Quadrature Climate Foundation (https://www.qc.foundation/)
