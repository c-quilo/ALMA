Photocatalysis of methane oxidizes it to CO2, effectively reducing its global warming potential (GWP) by at least 90%. Nitrous oxide can be reduced to nitrogen and oxygen by photocatalysis; meanwhile halocarbons can be mineralized by red-ox photocatalytic reactions to acid halides and CO2. Photocatalysis avoids the need for capture and sequestration of these atmospheric components. Here review an unusual hybrid device combining photocatalysis with carbon-free electricity with no-intermittency based on the solar updraft chimney. Then we review experimental evidence regarding photocatalytic transformations of non-CO2 GHGs. We propose to combine TiO2-photocatalysis with solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) to cleanse the atmosphere of non-CO2 GHGs. Worldwide installation of 50,000 SCPPs, each of capacity 200 MW, would generate a cumulative 34 PWh of renewable electricity by 2050, taking into account construction time. These SCPPs equipped with photocatalyst would process 1 atmospheric volume each 14–16 years, reducing or stopping the atmospheric growth rate of the non-CO2 GHGs and progressively reducing their atmospheric concentrations. Removal of methane, as compared to other GHGs, has enhanced efficacy in reducing radiative forcing because it liberates more °OH radicals to accelerate the cleaning of the troposphere. The overall reduction in non-CO2 GHG concentration would help to limit global temperature rise. By physically linking greenhouse gas removal to renewable electricity generation, the hybrid concept would avoid the moral hazard associated with most other climate engineering proposals."

However, conventional heterogeneous catalysts possess three major shortcomings that hinder their wide-spread application, including i) inferior catalytic activity and selectivity caused by a diversity of active sites, ii) tendency towards deactivation caused by agglomeration of catalyst particles, and iii) undesired carbon deposition in transformation of hydrocarbons. 1-4 In this research, we present a new kind of heterogeneous catalyst that consists of a liquid metal with dissolved catalytically active metal atoms, denoted as a heterogeneous droplet catalyst (HDC). Taking galinstan as the liquid metal with Cu as catalytically active metal solute (denoted as Cu-HDC) as an example, we demonstrate that the dissolved Cu atoms promote selective oxidation of methane into primary oxygenates at room temperature with a superb activity of 1940 mmol·gCu-1·h-1 and a selectivity of over 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art industrial catalysts. The liquid metal solvent ensures a high, entropically driven dispersion of the Cu atoms and prevents carbon deposition. The highly promising Cu-HDC catalyst shows a stable operation over 240 hours. By employing in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), near ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and density functional theory (DFT), we show that the narrow d-orbital of the dissolved Cu atoms in HDC facilitates formation of adsorbed methyl radicals *CH3 and impedes their transformation into *CH2 (where the * notation is used to denote an adsorption site) 5,6. These features enhance the selectivity towards primary oxygenates and prevent over-oxidization and formation of C2+ products. As the phase of the HDC is different from those of gas, aqueous and organic solution phases its separation is as facile as that of solid catalysts. Unlike conventional supported catalysts that are designed with well-defined crystal structures, crystal facets and defects, HDCs are characterized by weak interactions between the liquid metal support and the active metal solute, by having mobile surfaces and by dynamic catalytically active centers. These unprecedented features endow HDCs unique adsorption behavior and adaptive activation of molecules. For this reason, HDCs have the potential to become a major category of catalysts in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."

Herein, under visible irradiation (420 nm), the synergy of palladium (Pd) atom cocatalyst and oxygen vacancies (OVs) on In2O3 nanorods enables superior photocatalytic CH4 activation by O2. The optimized catalyst reaches ca. 100 μmol h-1 of C1 oxygenates, with a selectivity of primary products (CH3OH and CH3OOH) up to 82.5%. Mechanism investigation elucidates that such superior photocatalysis is induced by the dedicated function of Pd single atoms and oxygen vacancies on boosting hole and electron transfer, respectively. O2 is proven to be the only oxygen source for CH3OH production, while H2O acts as the promoter for efficient CH4 activation through ·OH production and facilitates product desorption as indicated by DFT modeling. This work thus provides new understandings on simultaneous regulation of both activity and selectivity by the synergy of single atom cocatalysts and oxygen vacancies."

CH 4 emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5 °C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH 4 emissions by developing large‐scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH 4 (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar‐driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH 4 removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar‐driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale."

Methane is the second most harmful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. There is an emerging technology proposed to incorporating photocatalysis with solar updraft Towers (SUT) to remove methane from the air at a planetary scale. In this study, we present a deep analysis by calculating the potential of methane removal in relation to the dimensions and configuration of SUT using different photocatalysts. The analysis shows that the methane removal rate increases with the SUT dimensions and can be enhanced by changing the configuration design. More importantly, the low methane removal rate on conventional TiO 2 photocatalyst can be significantly improved to, for example, 42.5% on a more effective Ag-doped ZnO photocatalyst in a 200 MW SUT while the photocatalytic reaction is the rate limiting step. The factors that may further affect the removal of methane, such as more efficient photocatalysts, night operation and reaction zone are discussed as possible solutions to further improve the system."

Nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in DRM because of their low cost and good catalytic activity. However, nickel application is limited by such as high-temperature metal sintering, carbon deposition and catalyst poisoning, which restricts the industrial application in DRM reaction. Compared with single metal nickel, the selective doping of multi metals and supports shows higher catalytic activity and anti poisoning tolerance due to changing the chemical and structural properties of the catalyst by enhancing the alloy effect and the force between metal and support. This paper mainly reviews the catalysts with anti-coking, anti-sintering and anti-sulfur poisoning by tuning the metal-metal interaction and metal-support interaction (MSI) in DRM. The modification strategies in interfacial engineering and structure-performance relationship are discussed, and the existing difficulties and future development of Ni-based catalysts are proposed."

Dry reforming of methane (DRM), a process operated at high temperature, usually involves fast C-H activation but sluggish carbon removal, resulting in coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. Studies focused solely on catalyst innovation are insufficient in addressing coke formation efficiently. Herein, we develop coke-free catalysts that balance kinetics of elementary steps for overall thermodynamics optimization. Beginning from a highly active cobalt aluminum oxide (CoAl 2 O 4 ) catalyst that is susceptible to severe coke formation, we substitute aluminum (Al) with gallium (Ga), reporting a CoAl 0.5 Ga 1.5 O 4 -R catalyst that performs DRM stably over 1000 hours without observable coke deposition. We find that Ga enhances DRM stability by suppressing C-H activation to balance carbon removal. A series of coke-free DRM catalysts are developed herein by partially substituting Al from CoAl 2 O 4 with other metals."
https://openalex.org/W4384931385,10.3390/methane2030019,Methane Oxidation via Chemical and Biological Methods: Challenges and Solutions,"Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has gained significant attention due to its environmental impact and economic potential. Chemical industries have focused on specialized catalytic systems, like zeolites, to convert methane into methanol. However, inherent limitations in selectivity, irreversibility, and pore blockages result in high costs and energy requirements, thus hindering their commercial viability and profitability. In contrast, biological methane conversion using methanotrophs has emerged as a promising alternative, offering higher conversion rates, self-renewability, improved selectivity, and economically feasible upstream processes. Nevertheless, biological methane oxidation encounters challenges including the difficulty in cultivating methanotrophs and their slow growth rates, which hinder large-scale bioprocessing. Another highlighted limitation is the limited mass transfer of methane into liquid in bioreactors. Practical strategies to enhance methane oxidation in biological systems, including optimizing reactor design to improve mass transfer, altering metal concentrations, genetic engineering of methane monooxygenases, enzyme encapsulation, and utilizing microbial consortia are discussed. By addressing the limitations of chemical approaches and highlighting the potential of biological methods, the review concluded that the utilization of genetically engineered methanotrophic biofilms on beads within a biotrickling reactor, along with enhanced aeration rates, will likely enhance methane oxidation and subsequent methane conversion rates."

Crystal structures determined using inactive, detergent-solubilized pMMO lack several conserved regions neighboring the proposed active site. We show that reconstituting pMMO in nanodiscs with lipids extracted from the native organism restores methane oxidation activity. Multiple nanodisc-embedded pMMO structures determined by cryo-electron microscopy to 2.14- to 2.46-angstrom resolution reveal the structure of pMMO in a lipid environment. The resulting model includes stabilizing lipids, regions of the PmoA and PmoC subunits not observed in prior structures, and a previously undetected copper-binding site in the PmoC subunit with an adjacent hydrophobic cavity. These structures provide a revised framework for understanding and engineering pMMO function."

Therefore, it is necessary to purify hydrogen to remove methane. The ZrMnFe getter commonly used in the industry reacts with methane at a temperature as high as 700 ∘C, and the removal depth is not sufficient. To overcome these limitations, Co partially substitutes Fe in the ZrMnFe alloy. The alloy was prepared by suspension induction melting method, and was characterized by means of XRD, ICP, SEM and XPS. The concentration of methane at the outlet was detected by gas chromatography to characterize the hydrogen purification performance of the alloy. The removal effect of the alloy on methane in hydrogen increases first and then decreases with the increase in substitution amount, and increases with the increase in temperature. Specifically, the ZrMnFe0.7Co0.3 alloy reduces methane levels in hydrogen from 10 ppm to 0.215 ppm at 500 ∘C. ZrMnFe0.7Co0.3 alloy can remove 50 ppm of methane in helium to less than 0.01 ppm at 450 ∘C, demonstrating its excellent methane reactivity. Moreover, Co substitution reduces the formation energy barrier of ZrC, and Co in the electron-rich state demonstrates superior catalytic activity for methane decomposition."

However, removing methane from the atmosphere will accelerate achieving net-zero targets, since its global warming potential is 28 over a 100-year period. This work presents first-of-its-kind process concepts for co-removal of methane and CO 2 that combines the catalytic conversion of methane step (thermal/photo-catalytic) with CO 2 capture. Proposed processes have been analyzed for streams with lean methane concentrations, which are non-fossil emissions originating in the agricultural sector or natural emissions from wetlands. If the proposed processes can overcome challenges in catalyst/material design to convert methane at low concentrations, they have the potential to remove more than 40% of anthropogenic and natural methane emissions from the atmosphere at a lower energy penalty than the state-of-the-art technologies for direct air capture of CO 2 ."

Here, we show that when the particle size of zinc oxide is reduced down to the nanoscale, it exhibits high activity for methane oxidation under simulated sunlight illumination, and nano silver decoration further enhances the photo-activity via the surface plasmon resonance. The high quantum yield of 8% at wavelengths &lt;400 nm and over 0.1% at wavelengths ∼470 nm achieved on the silver decorated zinc oxide nanostructures shows great promise for atmospheric methane oxidation. Moreover, the nano-particulate composites can efficiently photo-oxidize other small molecular hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane and ethylene, and in particular, can dehydrogenize methane to generate ethane, ethylene and so on. On the basis of the experimental results, a two-step photocatalytic reaction process is suggested to account for the methane photo-oxidation."

These cores have similar geometric and electronic structures, yet different reactivity with CH4: one reacts with a much lower activation enthalpy. In the present study, we couple experimental reactivity and spectroscopy studies to DFT calculations to arrive at structural models of the Cu-MOR active sites. We find that the more reactive core is located in a constricted region of the zeolite lattice. This leads to close van der Waals contact between the substrate and the zeolite lattice in the vicinity of the active site. The resulting enthalpy of substrate adsorption drives the subsequent H atom abstraction step-a manifestation of the ""nest"" effect seen in hydrocarbon cracking on acid zeolites. This defines a mechanism to tune the reactivity of metal active sites in microporous materials."

In nature, aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and anaerobic archaea are able to selectively oxidize methane using methane monooxygenase (MMO) and methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR) enzymes. Although significant progress has been made toward genetically manipulating these organisms for biotechnological applications, the enzymes themselves are slow, complex, and not recombinantly tractable in traditional industrial hosts. With turnover numbers of 0.16-13 s(-1), these enzymes pose a considerable upstream problem in the biological production of fuels or chemicals from methane. Methane oxidation enzymes will need to be engineered to be faster to enable high volumetric productivities; however, efforts to do so and to engineer simpler enzymes have been minimally successful. Moreover, known methane-oxidizing enzymes have different expression levels, carbon and energy efficiencies, require auxiliary systems for biosynthesis and function, and vary considerably in terms of complexity and reductant requirements. The pros and cons of using each methane-oxidizing enzyme for Bio-GTL are considered in detail. The future for these enzymes is bright, but a renewed focus on studying them will be critical to the successful development of biological processes that utilize methane as a feedstock."

Among these, copper and iron zeolites are remarkably reactive, hydroxylating methane and benzene selectively at low temperature to form methanol and phenol, respectively. In these systems, reactivity occurs at well-defined molecular transition metal active sites, and in this review we discuss recent advances in the spectroscopic characterization of these active sites and their reactive intermediates. Site-selective spectroscopy continues to play a key role, making it possible to focus on active sites that exist within a distribution of inactive spectator metal centers. The definition of the geometric and electronic structures of metallozeolites has advanced to the level of bioinorganic chemistry, enabling direct comparison of metallozeolite active sites to functionally analogous Fe and Cu sites in biology. We identify significant parallels and differences in the strategies used by each to achieve high reactivity, highlighting potentially interesting mechanisms to tune the performance of synthetic catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2431792572,10.1038/ncomms11900,Printable enzyme-embedded materials for methane to methanol conversion,"Abstract An industrial process for the selective activation of methane under mild conditions would be highly valuable for controlling emissions to the environment and for utilizing vast new sources of natural gas. The only selective catalysts for methane activation and conversion to methanol under mild conditions are methane monooxygenases (MMOs) found in methanotrophic bacteria; however, these enzymes are not amenable to standard enzyme immobilization approaches. Using particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), we create a biocatalytic polymer material that converts methane to methanol. We demonstrate embedding the material within a silicone lattice to create mechanically robust, gas-permeable membranes, and direct printing of micron-scale structures with controlled geometry. Remarkably, the enzymes retain up to 100% activity in the polymer construct. The printed enzyme-embedded polymer motif is highly flexible for future development and should be useful in a wide range of applications, especially those involving gas–liquid reactions."

Here, we describe the use of a biomimetic copper zeolite capable of converting atmospheric- and low-level methane at relatively low temperatures (e.g., 200-300 °C) in simulated air. Depending on the duty cycle, 40%, over 60%, or complete conversion could be achieved (via a two-step process at 450 °C activation and 200 °C reaction or a short and long activation under isothermal 310 °C conditions, respectively). Improved performance at longer activation was attributed to active site evolution, as determined by X-ray diffraction. The conversion rate increased over a range of methane concentrations (0.00019-2%), indicating the potential to abate methane from any sub-flammable stream. Finally, the uncompromised catalyst turnover for 300 h in simulated air illustrates the promise of using low-cost, earth-abundant materials to mitigate methane and slow the pace of climate change."

As some anthropogenic emissions cannot be zero, to compensate them it will be necessary to remove GHGs from the atmosphere. Among possible methods, the Iron Salt Aerosol (ISA) offers new possibilities, including removal of methane and several other GHGs, as well as carbon dioxide. Several studies suggest that anthropogenic emissions of iron participate in the current primary productivity. As plans to decarbonize the world economy might also have inadvertent warming effects due to the reduction of iron emissions from fossil fuels burning, iron additions might help address this issue. ISA is different from the method known as Ocean Iron Fertilization and the differences are explained. ISA mimic natural processes and the dust which probably participated in the cooling during the ice-ages over the past million years. Still larger laboratory trials, safety and environmental impact studies and global chemical computer modeling are necessary before ISA would be ready to be trialed. Desk and laboratory studies indicate low cost, easy deployment and efficacy, all of which can be validated by future small scale field trials, a step needed before, if successful, a possible implementation at a climate-relevant scale."

UTRC conducted basic research on the reaction rates of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The knowledge gained allowed validation of 1D and 3D prototype reactor models that guided further purifier development. Colleagues worldwide validated purifier prototypes in simulated realistic indoor environments. Prototype products were deployed in office environments both in the United States and France. As a result of these validation studies, it was discovered that both catalyst lifetime and byproduct formation are barriers to implementing this technology. Research is ongoing at the University of Connecticut that is applicable to extending catalyst lifetime, increasing catalyst efficiency and extending activation wavelength from the ultraviolet to the visible wavelengths. It is critical that catalyst lifetime is extended to realize cost effective implementation of PCO air purification."

Taking the synthetic ZnO nanosheets as an example, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra verified their lattice oxygen atoms could capture photoexcited holes and generate active O– species, which could efficiently abstract H from CH4 to generate ·CH3 radicals. Gibbs free energy calculations and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy corroborated the rate-limiting step was the first C–H bond activation process, whereas the exoergic oxidation of *CHO to HCOOH was easier than the endoergic overoxidation to CO, accounting for the selective production of liquid oxygenates. As a result, the formation rate of liquid oxygenates over ZnO nanosheets reached 2.21 mmol g–1 h–1 with a selectivity of 90.7% at atmospheric pressure and approximately 50 °C, outperforming previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions."

Power stations, ships and air traffic are among the most potent greenhouse gas emitters and are primarily responsible for global warming. Iron salt aerosols (ISAs), composed partly of iron and chloride, exert a cooling effect on climate in several ways. This article aims firstly to examine all direct and indirect natural climate cooling mechanisms driven by ISA tropospheric aerosol particles, showing their cooperation and interaction within the different environmental compartments. Secondly, it looks at a proposal to enhance the cooling effects of ISA in order to reach the optimistic target of the Paris climate agreement to limit the global temperature increase between 1.5 and 2 °C. Mineral dust played an important role during the glacial periods; by using mineral dust as a natural analogue tool and by mimicking the same method used in nature, the proposed ISA method might be able to reduce and stop climate warming. The first estimations made in this article show that by doubling the current natural iron emissions by ISA into the troposphere, i.e., by about 0.3 Tg Fe yr−1, artificial ISA would enable the prevention or even reversal of global warming. The ISA method proposed integrates technical and economically feasible tools."

Though previously neglected, methane is now gaining increasing public attention as a GHG. At the recent COP26 in Glasgow, 105 countries signed “the methane pledge” committing to a 30% reduction in emissions from oil and gas by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Removal methods are complementary to such reduction, as they can deal with other sources of anthropogenic emissions as well as legacy emissions already accumulated in the troposphere. They can also provide future insurance in case biogenic emissions start rising significantly. This article reviews proposed methods for atmospheric methane removal at a climatically significant scale. These methods include enhancement of natural hydroxyl and chlorine sinks, photocatalysis in solar updraft towers, zeolite catalyst in direct air capture devices, and methanotrophic bacteria. Though these are still at an early stage of development, a comparison is provided with some carbon dioxide removal methods in terms of expected costs. The cheapest method is potentially enhancement of the chlorine natural sink, costing as little as $1.6 per ton CO2-eq, but this should be carried out over remote areas to avoid endangering human health. Complementarity with methane emissions reduction is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4386348294,10.1088/1748-9326/acf603,Assessing the potential benefits of methane oxidation technologies using a concentration-based framework,"Abstract Lowering the atmospheric methane concentration is critical to reducing short-term global warming because of methane’s high radiative forcing and relatively short lifetime. Methane could be destroyed at its emissions sources or removed from the atmosphere by oxidizing it to carbon dioxide and water vapor, greatly lowering the warming effect. Here we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first estimate of the amount of methane that is emitted at a given concentration. We use this to assess the potential benefits (global temperature, air quality, and economic) of various technologies that could oxidize methane above specific concentration thresholds. We estimate that global mean surface temperature could be reduced by 0.2 °C ± 0.1 °C by continuously oxidizing all anthropogenic methane emitted above 1000 parts per million (the lowest concentration addressable with current commercial technologies). Continuously oxidizing all methane currently emitted above ten parts per million could cause 0.4 °C ± 0.2 °C of cooling. For the economic benefit of removing atmospheric methane to outweigh the associated energy cost, we show that reactors that use heat to oxidize methane must operate at most 3 °C ± 2 °C above ambient temperature while those that use light must convert at least 9% ± 8% of photons into oxidized methane molecules. Our framework can be used by scientists, engineers, and policymakers to better understand the connections between methane sources, including their emission rates and concentrations, and the technologies that can oxidize those emissions."

A Jekyll and Hyde character, it is a valuable energy source present as geological deposits of natural gas, however it is also potent greenhouse gas, released during many waste management processes. Gas-to-liquid technologies are being investigated as a means to exploit and monetise non-traditional and unutilised methane sources. The product identified as having the greatest potential is methanol due to it being a robust, commercially mature conversion process from methane and its beneficial fuel characteristics. Commercial methane to methanol conversion requires high temperatures and pressures, in an energy intensive and costly process. In contrast methanotrophic bacteria perform the desired transformation under ambient conditions, using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. Despite the great potential of these bacteria a number of biotechnical difficulties are hindering progress towards an industrially suitable process. We have identified five major challenges that exist as barriers to a viable conversion process that, to our knowledge, have not previously been examined as distinct process challenges. Although biotechnological applications of methanotrophic bacteria have been reviewed in part, no review has comprehensively covered progress and challenges for a methane to methanol process from an industrial perspective. All published examples to date of methanotroph catalysed conversion of methane to methanol are collated, and standardised to allow direct comparison. The focus will be on conversion of methane to methanol by whole-cell, wild type, methanotroph cultures, and the potential for their application in an industrially relevant process. A recent shift in the research community focus from a mainly biological angle to an overall engineering approach, offers potential to exploit methanotrophs in an industrially relevant biotechnological gas-to-liquid process. Current innovations and future opportunities are discussed."

The direct oxidation of methane to methanol is a chemically difficult transformation, accomplished in methanotrophs by complex methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme systems. These enzymes use iron or copper metallocofactors and have been the subject of detailed investigation. While the structure, function, and active site architecture of the copper-dependent particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) have been investigated extensively, its putative quaternary interactions, regulation, requisite cofactors, and mechanism remain enigmatic. The iron-dependent soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) has been characterized biochemically, structurally, spectroscopically, and, for the most part, mechanistically. Here, we review the history of MMO research, focusing on recent developments and providing an outlook for future directions of the field. Engineered biological catalysis systems and bioinspired synthetic catalysts may continue to emerge along with a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of biological methane oxidation. Harnessing the power of these enzymes will necessitate combined efforts in biochemistry, structural biology, inorganic chemistry, microbiology, computational biology, and engineering."

Oxygenation occurs at the binuclear iron active centre in the hydroxylase component (MMOH), to which electrons are passed from NAD(P)H via the reductase component (MMOR), along a pathway that is facilitated and controlled by the third component, protein B (MMOB). We previously demonstrated that electrons could be passed to MMOH from a hexapeptide‐modified gold electrode and thus cyclic voltammetry could be used to measure the redox potentials of the MMOH active site. Here we have shown that the reduction current is enhanced by the presence of catalase or if the reaction is performed in a flow‐cell, probably because oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide, by MMOH at the electrode surface and the hydrogen peroxide then inactivates the enzyme unless removed by catalase or a continuous flow of solution. Hydrogen peroxide production appears to be inhibited by MMOB, suggesting that MMOB is controlling the flow of electrons to MMOH as it does in the presence of MMOR and NAD(P)H. Most importantly, in the presence of MMOB and catalase, the electrode‐associated MMOH oxygenates acetonitrile to cyanoaldehyde and methane to methanol. Thus the electochemically driven sMMO showed the same catalytic activity and regulation by MMOB as the natural NAD(P)H‐driven reaction and may have the potential for development into an economic, NAD(P)H‐independent oxygenation catalyst. The significance of the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is not usually observed with the NAD(P)H‐driven system, is also discussed."

However, the lack of selective methane oxidation catalysts has limited such utilization. Starting from cytochrome P450 CYP102A1 (BM3) from Bacillus megaterium, which prefers C12-C20 fatty acids as its substrates, I investigated several protein engineering approaches to shift the enzyme’s substrate specificity toward small gaseous alkanes, with the ultimate goal of methane. By continuing previous directed evolution efforts in our group, a variant with wild-type-like affinity and catalytic efficiency for propane, P450PMO, was isolated. To alleviate the loss of protein thermostability (~10 °C) as a result of this approach, mutations were targeted to the BM3 active site with site saturation mutagenesis, targeted mutagenesis with a reduced set of amino acids, and computationally guided library designs. From these enzyme libraries, variants were identified that replicated much of the P450PMO activities with a minimal number of mutations while maintaining wild-type thermostability. Continuing the protein engineering with a high throughput ethane hydroxylation screen, variants with improved in vitro ethane hydroxylation activity were obtained. However, in whole-cell ethane bioconversions, BM3-derived variants could not match the activity of a natural P450 alkane hydroxylase, CYP153A6. To investigate the oxidation capability of the P450 oxo-ferryl porphyrin radical intermediate directly, I employed a variety of terminal oxidants to support P450 alkane hydroxylation reactions abridging the P450 catalytic cycle. In this study, the CYP153A6 oxo-ferryl intermediate was able to oxidize methane in reactions using iodosylbenzene, which demonstrated that direct methane-to-methanol conversion by a P450 heme porphyrin catalyst at ambient conditions is possible and does not necessarily require the use of additional effectors to alter the active site geometry."

CO is oxidized to CO2. 4. C1-C8 n-alkanes are hydroxylated, yielding mixtures of the corresponding 1- and 2-alcohols; no 3- or 4-alcohols are formed. 5. Terminal alkenes yield the corresponding 1,2-epoxides. cis- or trans-but-2-ene are each oxidized to a mixture of 2,3-epoxybutane and but-2-en-1-ol with retention of the cis or trans configuration in both products; 2-butanone is also formed from cis-but-2-ene only. 6. Dimethyl ether is oxidized. Diethyl ether undergoes sub-terminal oxidation, yielding ethanol and ethanal in equimolar amounts. 7. Methane mono-oxygenase also hydroxylates cyclic alkanes and aromatic compounds. However, styrene yields only styrene epoxide and pyridine yields only pyridine N-oxide. 8.

Of course, these reactions are inherently very favorable, and they occur rapidly with the release of a great deal of energy at high temperature. Nature has been able to tap this sequestered reservoir of energy with great spatial and temporal selectivity at ambient temperatures through the evolution of oxidase and oxygenase enzymes. One mechanism used by these enzymes for O2 activation has been studied in detail for the soluble form of the enzyme methane monooxygenase. These studies have revealed the step-by-step process of O2 activation and insertion into the ultimately stable C-H bond of methane. Additionally, an elegant regulatory mechanism has been defined that enlists size selection and quantum tunneling to allow methane oxidation to occur specifically in the presence of more easily oxidized substrates."

Bioconversion is a promising alternative to chemical catalysis, which requires extreme operating conditions and exhibits poor specificities. Though methanotrophs natively utilize methane, efforts have been focused on engineering platform organisms like Escherichia coli for synthetic methanotrophy. Here, a synthetic E. coli methanotroph was developed by engineering functional expression of the Methylococcus capsulatus soluble methane monooxygenase in vivo via expression of its cognate GroESL chaperone. Additional overexpression of E. coli GroESL further improved activity. Incorporation of an acetone formation pathway then enabled the conversion of methane to acetone in vivo , as validated via 13 C tracing. This work provides the first reported demonstration of methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals in a synthetic methanotroph."

The agricultural sector produces significant methane emissions, especially from livestock, waste management and rice cultivation. Rice fields alone generate around 9% of total anthropogenic emissions. Methane is produced in waterlogged paddy fields by methanogenic archaea, and transported to the atmosphere through the aerenchyma tissue of rice plants. Thus, bioengineering rice with catalysts to detoxify methane en route could contribute to an efficient emission mitigation strategy. Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is the predominant methane catalyst found in nature, and is an enzyme complex expressed by methanotrophic bacteria. Recombinant expression of pMMO has been challenging, potentially due to its membrane localization, multimeric structure, and polycistronic operon. Here we show the first steps towards the engineering of plants for methane detoxification with the three pMMO subunits expressed in the model systems tobacco and Arabidopsis. Membrane topology and protein–protein interactions were consistent with correct folding and assembly of the pMMO subunits on the plant ER. Moreover, a synthetic self-cleaving polypeptide resulted in simultaneous expression of all three subunits, although low expression levels precluded more detailed structural investigation. The work presents plant cells as a novel heterologous system for pMMO allowing for protein expression and modification."

The development of laser spectroscopy has made it possible to measure minute changes in the concentrations of trace gases and their isotopic analogs. These single or even multiply substituted species occur at ratios from percent to below parts per million and contain important information concerning trace gas sources and transformations. Due to their low abundance, minimizing spectral interference from other gases in a mixture is essential. Options including traps and membranes are available to remove many specific impurities. Methods for removing CH4, however, are extremely limited as methane has low reactivity and adsorbs poorly to most materials. Here we demonstrate a novel method for CH4 removal via chlorine-initiated oxidation. Our motivation in developing the technique was to overcome methane interference in measurements of N2O isotopic analogs when using a cavity ring-down spectrometer. We describe the design and validation of a proof-of-concept device and a kinetic model to predict the dependence of the methane removal efficiency on the methane concentration [CH4], chlorine photolysis rate JCl2, chlorine concentration [Cl2] and residence time tR. The model was validated by comparison to experimental data and then used to predict the possible formation of troublesome side products and by-products including CCl4 and HCl. The removal of methane could be maintained with a peak removal efficiency &gt;98 % for ambient levels of methane at a flow rate of 7.5 mL min−1 with [Cl2] at 50 ppm. These tests show that our method is a viable option for continuous methane scrubbing. Additional measures may be needed to avoid complications due to the introduction of Cl2 and formation of HCl. Note that the method will also oxidize most other common volatile organic compounds. The system was tested in combination with a cavity ring-down methane spectrometer, and the developed method was shown to be successful at removing methane interference."

With the space velocities and removal efficiencies of current three-dimensional technologies, volumes of 7–350 km 3 are required to remove 1 Tg CH 4 yr −1 . Two-dimensional solutions are limited by the transport rate of methane to a surface. If every molecule of methane that collides with the surface is removed, an area of 1130 km 2 is needed to remove 1 Tg CH 4 yr −1 at ambient concentration.
