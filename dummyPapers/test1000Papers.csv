Its zeotype cubic structure has a giant cell volume (approximately 702,000 cubic angstroms), a hierarchy of extra-large pore sizes (approximately 30 to 34 angstroms), and a Langmuir surface area for N2 of approximately 5900 +/- 300 square meters per gram. Beside the usual properties of porous compounds, this solid has potential as a nanomold for monodisperse nanomaterials, as illustrated here by the incorporation of Keggin polyanions within the cages."

We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt3Ni(111) surface has an unusual electronic structure (d-band center position) and arrangement of surface atoms in the near-surface region. Under operating conditions relevant to fuel cells, its near-surface layer exhibits a highly structured compositional oscillation in the outermost and third layers, which are Pt-rich, and in the second atomic layer, which is Ni-rich. The weak interaction between the Pt surface atoms and nonreactive oxygenated species increases the number of active sites for O2 adsorption."

Because of the wide range of possible binary and ternary ionic liquids, they offer a potentially wide range of solvent properties. In their Perspective,
 Rogers and Seddon
 review recent progress on developing new ionic liquid solvents for use in chemical synthesis, catalysis, fuel cells, and other applications. Ionic liquids are considered advantageous not only because of their versatility but also for their green credentials, although it is important to remember that not all ionic liquids are environmentally benign. One industrial process has been reported, and others may not be far behind. The authors conclude that in the next decade, ionic liquids are likely to replace conventional solvents in many applications."

The physical properties are significantly affected by the structure of the carboxylic acid but the phase behavior of the mixtures can be simply modeled by taking account of the mole fraction of carboxylic acid in the mixture. The physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension of these DES are similar to ambient temperature ionic liquids and insight into the cause of these properties is gained using hole-theory. It is shown that the conductivity and viscosity of these liquids is controlled by ion mobility and the availability of voids of suitable dimensions, and this is consistent with the fluidity of other ionic liquids and molten salts. The DES are also shown to be good solvents for metal oxides, which could have potential application for metal extraction."

Gold is equally effective as a heterogeneous or a homogeneous catalyst and in this Review we attempt to marry these two facets to demonstrate this new found and general efficacy of gold. The latest discoveries are placed within a historical context, but the main thrust is to highlight the new catalytic possibilities that gold-catalyzed reactions currently offer the synthetic chemist, in particular in redox reactions and nucleophilic additions to pi systems. Indeed gold has proved to be an effective catalyst for many reactions for which a catalyst had not been previously identified, and many new discoveries are still expected."

Utilizing the abundant solar energy to convert CO2 into fuels such as methane or methanol could address both problems simultaneously as well as provide a convenient means of energy storage. In this Review, current approaches for the heterogeneous photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on TiO2 and other metal oxide, oxynitride, sulfide, and phosphide semiconductors are presented. Research in this field is focused primarily on the development of novel nanostructured photocatalytic materials and on the investigation of the mechanism of the process, from light absorption through charge separation and transport to CO2 reduction pathways. The measures used to quantify the efficiency of the process are also discussed in detail."

Such a concept has already proven fruitful for a number of electronic applications in the area of ultrathin and flexible devices. Here, we expand the range of such structures to photoactive ones by using semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)/graphene stacks. Van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states of TMDC guarantees enhanced light-matter interactions, leading to enhanced photon absorption and electron-hole creation (which are collected in transparent graphene electrodes). This allows development of extremely efficient flexible photovoltaic devices with photoresponsivity above 0.1 ampere per watt (corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of above 30%)."

High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells."

The quite remarkable correlation of their catalytic behavior with the available structural data, coordination chemistry, and organometallic reactivity patterns, including relativistic effects, allows the underlying principles of catalytic carbophilic activation by pi acids to be formulated. The spectrum of reactivity extends beyond their utility as catalytic and benign alternatives to conventional stoichiometric pi acids. The resulting reactivity profile allows this entire field of catalysis to be rationalized, and brings together the apparently disparate electrophilic metal carbene and nonclassical carbocation explanations. The advances in coupling, cycloisomerization, and structural reorganization--from the design of new transformations to the improvement to known reactions--are highlighted in this Review. The application of platinum- and gold-catalyzed transformations in natural product synthesis is also discussed."

However, the catalysts that have been identified so far are relatively inactive with primary alkyl alcohols. We showed that Au/Pd-TiO2 catalysts give very high turnover frequencies (up to 270,000 turnovers per hour) for the oxidation of alcohols, including primary alkyl alcohols. The addition of Au to Pd nanocrystals improved the overall selectivity and, using scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we showed that the Au-Pd nanocrystals were made up of a Au-rich core with a Pd-rich shell, indicating that the Au electronically influences the catalytic properties of Pd."

However, thin solid films of a perovskite absorber should be capable of operating at the highest efficiency in a simple planar heterojunction configuration. Here, it is shown that film morphology is a critical issue in planar heterojunction CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3‐ x Cl x solar cells. The morphology is carefully controlled by varying processing conditions, and it is demonstrated that the highest photocurrents are attainable only with the highest perovskite surface coverages.

Key to evacuating the initially solvent-filled materials without pore collapse, and thereby accessing the ultrahigh areas, is the use of a supercritical CO(2) activation technique. Additionally, we demonstrate computationally that by shifting from phenyl groups to ""space efficient"" acetylene moieties as linker expansion units, the hypothetical maximum surface area for a MOF material is substantially greater than previously envisioned (~14600 m(2)/g (or greater) versus ~10500 m(2)/g)."

Kinetic and mechanistic data relevant to the tropospheric degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOC), and the production of secondary pollutants, have previously been used to define a protocol which underpinned the construction of a near-explicit Master Chemical Mechanism. In this paper, an update to the previous protocol is presented, which has been used to define degradation schemes for 107 non-aromatic VOC as part of version 3 of the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3). The treatment of 18 aromatic VOC is described in a companion paper. The protocol is divided into a series of subsections describing initiation reactions, the reactions of the radical intermediates and the further degradation of first and subsequent generation products. Emphasis is placed on updating the previous information, and outlining the methodology which is specifically applicable to VOC not considered previously (e.g. a- and b-pinene). The present protocol aims to take into consideration work available in the open literature up to the beginning of 2001, and some other studies known by the authors which were under review at the time. Application of MCM v3 in appropriate box models indicates that the representation of isoprene degradation provides a good description of the speciated distribution of oxygenated organic products observed in reported field studies where isoprene was the dominant emitted hydrocarbon, and that the a-pinene degradation chemistry provides a good description of the time dependence of key gas phase species in a-pinene/NOX photo-oxidation experiments carried out in the European Photoreactor (EUPHORE). Photochemical Ozone Creation Potentials (POCP) have been calculated for the 106 non-aromatic non-methane VOC in MCM v3 for idealised conditions appropriate to north-west Europe, using a photochemical trajectory model. The POCP values provide a measure of the relative ozone forming abilities of the VOC. Where applicable, the values are compared with those calculated with previous versions of the MCM."

Despite the well‐known association between ethylene and stress signalling, its effects on stomatal movements are largely unexplored. Here, genetic and physiological data are provided that position ethylene into the Arabidopsis guard cell signalling network, and demonstrate a functional link between ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). In wild‐type leaves, ethylene induces stomatal closure that is dependent on H 2 O 2 production in guard cells, generated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase AtrbohF. Ethylene‐induced closure is inhibited by the ethylene antagonists 1‐MCP and silver. The ethylene receptor mutants etr1–1 and etr1–3 are insensitive to ethylene in terms of stomatal closure and H 2 O 2 production. Stomata of the ethylene signalling ein2–1 and arr2 mutants do not close in response to either ethylene or H 2 O 2 but do generate H 2 O 2 following ethylene challenge. Thus, the data indicate that ethylene and H 2 O 2 signalling in guard cells are mediated by ETR1 via EIN2 and ARR2‐dependent pathway(s), and identify AtrbohF as a key mediator of stomatal responses to ethylene."

Solution-processed semiconductors tend to have a high density of defect states and exhibit a large degree of electronic disorder. Perovskites appear to go against this trend, and despite relatively little knowledge of the impact of electronic defects, certified solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.9% have been achieved. Here, through treatment of the crystal surfaces with the Lewis bases thiophene and pyridine, we demonstrate significantly reduced nonradiative electron–hole recombination within the CH3NH3PbI3–xClx perovskite, achieving photoluminescence lifetimes which are enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude, up to 2 μs. We propose that this is due to the electronic passivation of under-coordinated Pb atoms within the crystal. Through this method of Lewis base passivation, we achieve power conversion efficiencies for solution-processed planar heterojunction solar cells enhanced from 13% for the untreated solar cells to 15.3% and 16.5% for the thiophene and pyridine-treated solar cells, respectively."

We then discuss the suitability of using ionic liquids as novel, environmentally benign solvents with which to capture CO2. In addition, we consider alternatives to simply sequestering CO2—we present a discussion on the possibility of recycling captured CO2 and exploiting it as a C1 building block for the sustainable manufacture of polymers, fine chemicals, and liquid fuels. Finally, we present a discussion of relevant systems engineering methodologies in carbon capture system design."

We have used aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to analyze several iron oxide–supported catalyst samples, ranging from those with little or no activity to others with high activities. High catalytic activity for carbon monoxide oxidation is correlated with the presence of bilayer clusters that are ∼0.5 nanometer in diameter and contain only ∼10 gold atoms. The activity of these bilayer clusters is consistent with that demonstrated previously with the use of model catalyst systems."

The positive region on X corresponds to the electronically-depleted outer lobe of the half-filled p-type orbital of X that is involved in forming the covalent bond to R. This depletion is labeled a σ-hole. The resulting positive electrostatic potential is along the extension of the R–X bond, which accounts for the directionality of halogen bonding. Positive σ-holes can also be found on covalently-bonded Group IV–VI atoms, which can similarly interact electrostatically with negative sites. Since positive σ-holes often exist in conjunction with negative potentials on other portions of the atom's surface, such atoms can interact electrostatically with both nucleophiles and electrophiles, as has been observed in surveys of crystallographic structures. Experimental as well as computational studies indicate that halogen and other σ-hole interactions can be competitive with hydrogen bonding, which itself can be viewed as a subset of σ-hole bonding."

We show that a combination of high resolution in situ X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopies offer a powerful approach to monitor the deoxygenation process and comprehensively evaluate the electronic structure of Graphene Oxide thin films at different stages of the thermal reduction process. It is established that the edge plane carboxyl groups are highly unstable, whereas carbonyl groups are more difficult to remove. The results consistently support the formation of phenol groups through reaction of basal plane epoxide groups with adjacent hydroxyl groups at moderate degrees of thermal activation (~400 {\deg}C). The phenol groups are predominant over carbonyl groups and survive even at a temperature of 1000 {\deg}C. For the first time a drastic increase in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level at 600 {\deg}C is observed, suggesting a progressive restoration of aromatic structure in the thermally reduced graphene oxide"

See http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/cp/b1/b106900d/,"ATR and transmission IR spectroscopy have been used to investigate the state of water in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) based on the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation with the anions: [PF6]−, [SbF6]−, [BF4]−, [ClO4]−, [CF3SO3]−, [(CF3SO2)2N]−, [NO3]− and [CF3CO2]−. It has been shown that in these RTILs water molecules absorbed from the air are present mostly in the ""free"" (not self-associated) state, bound via H-bonding with [PF6]−, [BF4]−, [SbF6]−, [ClO4]−, [CF3SO3]−, [(CF3SO2)2N]− with the concentrations of dissolved water in the range 0.2–1.0 mol dm−3. It has been concluded that most of the water molecules at these concentrations exist in symmetric 1 : 2 type H-bonded complexes: anion...HOH...anion. Additional evidence that the preferred sites of interaction with water molecules are the anions has been obtained from the experiments with RTILs of the 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium and 1-butyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolium cations. Water molecules can also form associated liquid-like formations in RTILs with anions of stronger basicity such as [NO3]− and [CF3CO2]−. When these RTILs are exposed to air the water concentrations exceed 1.0 mol dm−3. The strength of H-bonding between water molecules and anions increases in the order [PF6]− < [SbF6]− < [BF4]− < [(CF3SO2)2N]− < [ClO4]− < [CF3SO3]− < [NO3]− < [CF3CO2]−.

In contrast, Li+ may be extracted from Mn4+-based solids, e.g., Li2MnO3, without oxidation of Mn4+. A mechanism involving simultaneous Li and O removal is often proposed. Here, we demonstrate directly, by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), that O2 is evolved from such Mn4+ -containing compounds, Li[Ni(0.2)Li(0.2)Mn(0.6)]O2, on charging and using powder neutron diffraction show that O loss from the surface is accompanied by diffusion of transition metal ions from surface to bulk where they occupy vacancies created by Li removal. The composition of the compound moves toward MO(2). Understanding such unconventional Li extraction is important because Li-Mn-Ni-O compounds, irrespective of whether they contain Co, can, after O loss, store 200 mAhg(-1) of charge compared with 140 mAhg(-1) for LiCoO(2)."

We spun fibers and ribbons of carbon nanotubes directly from the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis zone of a furnace using a liquid source of carbon and an iron nanocatalyst. This process was realized through the appropriate choice of reactants, control of the reaction conditions, and continuous withdrawal of the product with a rotating spindle used in various geometries. This direct spinning from a CVD reaction zone is extendable to other types of fiber and to the spin coating of rotating objects in general."

These may be of biological, organic and inorganic in origin within water and air. The efficient and successful application of photocatalysis demands that the pollutant, the catalyst and source of illumination are in close proximity or contact with each other. The ability of advanced oxidation technology to remove low levels of persistent organic pollutants as well as microorganisms in water has been widely demonstrated and, progressively, the technology is now being commercialized in many areas of the world including developing nations. This review considers recent developments in the research and application of heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis for the treatment of low-level concentrations of pollutants in water and air using titanium dioxide as a “model” semiconductor. The review considers charge transport characteristics on the semiconductor surface, photocatalyst reactor design and organic degradation mechanistic pathways. The effects of photoreactor operating parameters on the photocatalytic process are discussed in addition to mineralization and disinfection kinetics."

This article provides a detailed critique of the present work on this problem. It promotes the point of view that future considerations of ionic liquids should be based on the modern statistical mechanics of dense Coulomb systems, or density-functional theory, rather than classical electrochemical theories which hinge on a dilute-solution approximation. The article will, however, contain more questions than answers. To trigger the discussion, it starts with a simplified original result. A new analytical formula is derived to rationalize the potential dependence of double-layer capacitance at a planar metal-ionic liquid interface. The theory behind it has a mean-field character, based on the Poisson-Boltzmann lattice-gas model, with a modification to account for the finite volume occupied by ions. When the volume of liquid excluded by the ions is taken to be zero (that is, if ions are extremely sparsely packed in the liquid), the expression reduces to the nonlinear Gouy-Chapman law, the canonical result typically used to describe the potential dependence of capacitance in electrochemical double layers. If ionic volume exclusion takes more realistic values, the formula shows that capacitance-potential curves for an ionic liquid may differ dramatically from the Gouy-Chapman law. Capacitance has a maximum close to the potential of zero charge, rather than the familiar minimum. At large potenials, capacitance decreases with the square root of potential, rather than increases exponentially. The reported formula does not take into account the specific adsorption of ions, which, if present, can complicate the analysis of experimental data. Since electrochemists use to think about the capacitance data in terms of the classical Gouy-Chapman theory, which, as we know, should be good only for electrolytes of moderate concentration, the question of which result is ""better"" arises. Experimental data are sparse, but a quick look at them suggests that the new formula seems to be closer to reality. Opinions here could, however, split. Indeed, a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations has shown that incorporation of restricted-volume effects in the mean-field theory of electrolyte solutions may give results that are worse than the simple Gouy-Chapman theory. Generally, should the simple mean-field theory work for such highly concentrated ionic systems, where the so-called ion-correlation effects must be strong? It may not, as it does not incorporate a possibility of charge-density oscillations. Somehow, to answer this question definitely, one should do further work. This could be based on density-functional theory (and possibly not on what is referred to as local density approximation but rather ""weighted density approximation""), field theory methods for the account of fluctuations in the calculation of partition function, heuristic integral equation theory extended to the nonlinear response, systematic force-field computer simulations, and, most importantly, experiments with independently determined potentials of zero charge, as discussed in the paper."

This review examines the current state of ionic liquid‐based electrochemistry, with particular focus on the work of the last decade. Being composed entirely of ions and possessing wide electrochemical windows (often in excess of 5 volts), it is not difficult to see why these compounds are seen by electrochemists as attractive potential solvents. Accordingly, an examination of the pertinent properties of ionic liquids is presented, followed by an assessment of their application to date across the various electrochemical disciplines, concluding with an outlook viewing current problems and directions."

Their high productivity and the associated high lipid yields make them attractive options. In this review, we analyse a number aspects of large-scale lipid and overall algal biomass production from a biochemical and energetic standpoint. We illustrate that the maximum conversion efficiency of total solar energy into primary photosynthetic organic products falls in the region of 10%. Biomass biochemical composition further conditions this yield: 30 and 50% of the primary product mass is lost on producing cell protein and lipid. Obtained yields are one third to one tenth of the theoretical ones. Wasted energy from captured photons is a major loss term and a major challenge in maximising mass algal production. Using irradiance data and kinetic parameters derived from reported field studies, we produce a simple model of algal biomass production and its variation with latitude and lipid content. An economic analysis of algal biomass production considers a number of scenarios and the effect of changing individual parameters. Our main conclusions are that: (i) the biochemical composition of the biomass influences the economics, in particular, increased lipid content reduces other valuable compounds in the biomass; (ii) the “biofuel only” option is unlikely to be economically viable; and (iii) among the hardest problems in assessing the economics are the cost of the CO2 supply and uncertain nature of downstream processing. We conclude by considering the pressing research and development needs."

One type of non-Portland cement that is attracting particular attention is based on alkali-aluminosilicate chemistry, including the class of binders that have become known as geopolymers. These materials offer technical properties comparable to those of Portland cement, but with a much lower CO 2 footprint and with the potential for performance advantages over traditional cements in certain niche applications. This review discusses the synthesis of alkali-activated binders from blast furnace slag, calcined clay (metakaolin), and fly ash, including analysis of the chemical reaction mechanisms and binder phase assemblages that control the early-age and hardened properties of these materials, in particular initial setting and long-term durability.

We show that this process is facilitated through the formation of excited, delocalized band states. In our experiments on organic photovoltaic cells, these states were accessed for a short time (&lt;1ps) via IR optical excitation of electron-hole pairs bound at the heterojunction. Atomistic modelling showed that the IR photons promote bound charge pairs to delocalised band states, similar to those formed just after singlet exciton dissociation, which indicates that such states act as the gateway for charge separation. Our results suggest that charge separation in efficient organic photoconversion systems, occurs through hot-state charge delocalisation rather than energy-gradient-driven intermolecular hopping."

Herein, an effective strategy for synthesizing extremely active graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) from a low‐cost precursor, urea, is reported. The g‐C 3 N 4 exhibits an extraordinary hydrogen‐evolution rate (ca. 20 000 μmol h −1 g −1 under full arc), which leads to a high turnover number (TON) of over 641 after 6 h. The reaction proceeds for more than 30 h without activity loss and results in an internal quantum yield of 26.5 % under visible light, which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than that observed for any other existing g‐C 3 N 4 photocatalysts. Furthermore, it was found by experimental analysis and DFT calculations that as the degree of polymerization increases and the proton concentration decreases, the hydrogen‐evolution rate is significantly enhanced."

Perovskite films based on CH3NH3PbI3 undergo rapid degradation when exposed to oxygen and light. Here, we report mechanistic insights into this oxygen-induced photodegradation from a range of experimental and computational techniques. We find fast oxygen diffusion into CH3NH3PbI3 films is accompanied by photo-induced formation of highly reactive superoxide species. Perovskite films composed of small crystallites show higher yields of superoxide and lower stability. Ab initio simulations indicate that iodide vacancies are the preferred sites in mediating the photo-induced formation of superoxide species from oxygen. Thin-film passivation with iodide salts is shown to enhance film and device stability. The understanding of degradation phenomena gained from this study is important for the future design and optimization of stable perovskite solar cells. Determining the degradation pathways in lead halide perovskites is key to its development as a viable solar technology. Aristidouet al. identify iodide vacancies as the preferred sites in mediating the photo-induced formation of superoxide species from intercalated oxygen."

This solution method offers finer tailoring of the size and shape of the nanocrystals and is complementary to most reported physical methods. Understanding the morphological effects of pure or modified zinc oxide nanocrystals on photocatalytic activity is important in regard to enhanced solar energy capture and utilization but has been scarcely addressed in the past. The photocatalytic rate was found to have no dependence on ZnO particle size, but the shape factor seems to be of overriding importance. Hexagonal platelike nanocrystals were found to display at least 5 times higher activity than rod-shaped crystals, which clearly suggests that the polar (001) and (001) faces are more active surfaces than the nonpolar surfaces perpendicular to them."

Recent publications have attempted to determine the polarity of RTILs using empirical solvent polarity scales. The results have indicated that most RTILs have similar polarities. Nevertheless, RTILs are capable of behaving quite differently when used as solvents in organic synthesis, matrixes in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, liquid-liquid extraction, and as stationary phases in gas chromatography. The work presented in this study uses a linear free energy approach to characterize 17 RTILs on the basis of their distinct multiple solvation interactions with probe solute molecules. This model provides data that can be used to help identify the interactions and properties that are important for specific chemical applications."

The growth properties are studied as a function of the Ni catalyst layer thickness, bias voltage, deposition temperature, C2H2:NH3 ratio, and pressure. It was found that the diameter, growth rate, and areal density of the nanotubes are controlled by the initial thickness of the catalyst layer. The alignment of the nanotubes depends on the electric field. Our results indicate that the growth occurs by diffusion of carbon through the Ni catalyst particle, which rides on the top of the growing tube."

Here we show that pyrolysis oils can be converted into industrial commodity chemical feedstocks using an integrated catalytic approach that combines hydroprocessing with zeolite catalysis. The hydroprocessing increases the intrinsic hydrogen content of the pyrolysis oil, producing polyols and alcohols. The zeolite catalyst then converts these hydrogenated products into light olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons in a yield as much as three times higher than that produced with the pure pyrolysis oil. The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons and light olefins from the biomass conversion over zeolite is proportional to the intrinsic amount of hydrogen added to the biomass feedstock during hydroprocessing. The total product yield can be adjusted depending on market values of the chemical feedstocks and the relative prices of the hydrogen and biomass."

Recent molecular simulation and density functional (DFT) studies of the physisorption of gases by model pore structures have greatly improved our understanding of the mechanisms of hysteresis and it is therefore timely to revisit the IUPAC recommendations. In this review, we conclude that there is no immediate need to change the IUPAC classification of physisorption isotherms and hysteresis loops. However, in the light of recent advances, we are able to offer a revised checklist for the analysis of nitrogen isotherms on nanoporous solids: this includes a carefully regulated application of DFT in place of a classical procedure such as the well-known Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method."

Multivariate statistical modeling of the spectra shows that the genetic predisposition of the 129S6 mouse to impaired glucose homeostasis and NAFLD is associated with disruptions of choline metabolism, i.e., low circulating levels of plasma phosphatidylcholine and high urinary excretion of methylamines (dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide), coprocessed by symbiotic gut microbiota and mammalian enzyme systems. Conversion of choline into methylamines by microbiota in strain 129S6 on a high-fat diet reduces the bioavailability of choline and mimics the effect of choline-deficient diets, causing NAFLD. These data also indicate that gut microbiota may play an active role in the development of insulin resistance."

The model captures overscreening from short-range correlations, dominant at small voltages, and steric constraints of finite ion sizes, which prevail at large voltages. Increasing the voltage gradually suppresses overscreening in favor of the crowding of counterions in a condensed inner layer near the electrode.

These films demonstrate exceptional performance as molecular sieves with high gas permeabilities and good selectivities for smaller gas molecules, such as hydrogen and oxygen, over larger molecules, such as nitrogen and methane.

Carbon monoxide gas is known to dilate blood vessels in a manner similar to nitric oxide and has been recently shown to possess antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. We report that a series of transition metal carbonyls, termed here carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), liberate CO to elicit direct biological activities. Specifically, spectrophotometric and NMR analysis revealed that dimanganese decacarbonyl and tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer release CO in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, CO-RMs caused sustained vasodilation in precontracted rat aortic rings, attenuated coronary vasoconstriction in hearts ex vivo, and significantly reduced acute hypertension in vivo. These vascular effects were mimicked by induction of HO-1 after treatment of animals with hemin, which increases endogenously generated CO. Thus, we have identified a novel class of compounds that are useful as prototypes for studying the bioactivity of CO. In the long term, transition metal carbonyls could be utilized for the therapeutic delivery of CO to alleviate vascular- and immuno-related dysfunctions.

Complete dissolution was achieved by heating the sample in an oil bath, although wood dissolution can be accelerated by microwave pulses or ultrasound irradiation. It has been shown that [C2mim]OAc is a better solvent for wood than 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl) and that variables such as type of wood, initial wood load, particle size, etc. affect dissolution and dissolution rates; for example, red oak dissolves better and faster than southern yellow pine. Carbohydrate-free lignin and cellulose-rich materials can be obtained by using the proper reconstitution solvents (e.g., acetone/water 1 : 1 v/v) and approximately 26.1% and 34.9% reductions of lignin content in the reconstituted cellulose-rich materials (from pine and oak, respectively) have been achieved in one dissolution/reconstitution cycle. The regenerated cellulose-rich materials and lignin fractions were characterized and compared with the original wood samples and biopolymer standards. For pine, 59% of the holocellulose (i.e., the sum of cellulose and hemicellulose) in the original wood can be recovered in the cellulose-rich reconstituted material; whereas 31% and 38% of the original lignin is recovered, respectively, as carbohydrate-free lignin and as carbohydrate-bonded lignin in the cellulose-rich material."

Hole lifetimes were measured using transient absorption spectroscopy over a range of excitation intensities. The lifetimes of the holes were modulated by the use of exogenous scavengers and were also found to vary systematically with the excitation intensity. In all cases the quantum yield of oxygen production is found to be linked to the light intensity used, ranging from below 1 sun equivalent to nearly 1 sun equivalent. We also provide evidence that oxygen production requires four photons for each molecule of oxygen, which is reminiscent of the natural photosynthetic water-splitting mechanism. This in turn suggests a mechanism for oxygen production which requires four-hole chemistry, presumably via three, as yet unidentified intermediates. It is also shown that at excitation densities on the order of 1 sun, nongeminate electron-hole recombination limits the quantum yield significantly."

This process requires a strong modification of the near-surface region of palladium, in which carbon (from fragmented feed molecules) occupies interstitial lattice sites. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements under reaction conditions indicated that much less carbon was dissolved in palladium during unselective, total hydrogenation. Additional studies of hydrogen content using in situ prompt gamma activation analysis, which allowed us to follow the hydrogen content of palladium during catalysis, indicated that unselective hydrogenation proceeds on hydrogen-saturated beta-hydride, whereas selective hydrogenation was only possible after decoupling bulk properties from the surface events. Thus, the population of subsurface sites of palladium, by either hydrogen or carbon, governs the hydrogenation events on the surface."

The perceived benefits provide the underpinning rationale for much of the public support directed towards micro-algae research. Here we examine three aspects of micro-algae production that will ultimately determine the future economic viability and environmental sustainability: the energy and carbon balance, environmental impacts and production cost. This analysis combines systematic review and meta-analysis with insights gained from expert workshops. We find that achieving a positive energy balance will require technological advances and highly optimised production systems. Aspects that will need to be addressed in a viable commercial system include: energy required for pumping, the embodied energy required for construction, the embodied energy in fertilizer, and the energy required for drying and de-watering. The conceptual and often incomplete nature of algae production systems investigated within the existing literature, together with limited sources of primary data for process and scale-up assumptions, highlights future uncertainties around micro-algae biofuel production. Environmental impacts from water management, carbon dioxide handling, and nutrient supply could constrain system design and implementation options. Cost estimates need to be improved and this will require empirical data on the performance of systems designed specifically to produce biofuels. Significant (>50%) cost reductions may be achieved if CO2, nutrients and water can be obtained at low cost. This is a very demanding requirement, however, and it could dramatically restrict the number of production locations available."

Since CO2 is a thermodynamically stable compound, its reduction must not consume additional energy or increase net CO2 emissions. Renewable sources like solar energy provide readily available and continuous light supply required for driving this conversion process. Therefore, the use of solar energy to drive CO2 photocatalytic reactions simultaneously addresses the aforementioned challenges, while producing sustainable fuels or chemicals suitable for use in existing energy infrastructure. Recent progress in this area has focused on the development and testing of promising TiO2 based photocatalysts in different reactor configurations due to their unique physicochemical properties for CO2 photoreduction. TiO2 nanostructured materials with different morphological and textural properties modified by using organic and inorganic compounds as photosensitizers (dye sensitization), coupling semiconductors of different energy levels or doping with metals or non-metals have been tested. This review presents contemporary views on state of the art in photocatalytic CO2 reduction over titanium oxide (TiO2) nanostructured materials, with emphasis on material design and reactor configurations. In this review, we discuss existing and recent TiO2 based supports, encompassing comparative analysis of existing systems, novel designs being employed to improve selectivity and photoconversion rates as well as emerging opportunities for future development, crucial to the field of CO2 photocatalytic reduction. The influence of different operating and morphological variables on the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 photoreduction is reviewed. Finally, perspectives on the progress of TiO2 induced photocatalysis for CO2 photoreduction will be presented."

Because of meticulous design and ingenious hierarchical structuration of porosities through the mimicking of natural systems, hierarchically structured porous materials can provide large surface areas for reaction, interfacial transport, or dispersion of active sites at different length scales of pores and shorten diffusion paths or reduce diffusion effect. By the incorporation of macroporosity in materials, light harvesting can be enhanced, showing the importance of macrochannels in light related systems such as photocatalysis and photovoltaics. A state‐of‐the‐art review of the applications of hierarchically structured porous materials in energy conversion and storage is presented. Their involvement in energy conversion such as in photosynthesis, photocatalytic H 2 production, photocatalysis, or in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and fuel cells (FCs) is discussed. Energy storage technologies such as Li‐ions batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, and solar thermal storage developed based on hierarchically porous materials are then discussed. The links between the hierarchically porous structures and their performances in energy conversion and storage presented can promote the design of the novel structures with advanced properties."

In this Perspective, we highlight our current understanding of the factors that control the cathode performance. We review the influence of catalyst material, electrolyte, and the structure of the interface at the mesoscopic scale. We provide original theoretical data on the role of the geometry of the active site and its influence on activity and selectivity. We have also conducted a series of original experiments on (i) the effect of pH on H2O2 production on glassy carbon, pure metals, and metal–mercury alloys, and (ii) the influence of cell geometry and mass transport in liquid half-cells in comparison to membrane electrode assemblies."

They facilitate the determination of the kinetics and mechanism of catalytic turnover-both experimentally and computationally-and make accessible the energetics of various intermediates (including short-lived transition states). These facts in turn offer a rational strategic principle for the design of new catalysts and the improvement of existing ones. It is generally possible to prepare soluble molecular fragments that circumscribe the single-site, thus enabling a direct comparison to be made, experimentally, between the catalytic performance of the same active site when functioning as a heterogeneous (continuous solid) as well as a homogeneous (dispersed molecular) catalyst. This approach also makes it possible to modify the immediate atomic environment as well as the central atomic structure of the active site. From the practical standpoint, SSHC exhibit very high selectivities leading to the production of sharply defined molecular products, just as do their homogeneous analogues. Given that mesoporous silicas with very large internal surface areas are ideal supports for SSHC, and that more than a quarter of the elements of the Periodic Table may be grafted as active sites onto such silicas, there is abundant scope for creating new catalytic opportunities."

PAEs with apparent Brunauer-Emmet-Teller surface areas of more than 1000 m(2)/g were produced. The materials were found to have very good chemical and thermal stability and retention of microporosity under a variety of conditions. It was shown that physical properties such as micropore size, surface area, and hydrogen uptake could be controlled in a ""quantized"" fashion by varying the monomer strut length, as for metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks, even though the networks were amorphous in nature. For the first time, it was demonstrated that these properties can also be fine-tuned in a continuous manner via statistical copolymerization of monomer struts with differing lengths. This provides an unprecedented degree of direct synthetic control over micropore properties in an organic network."

However, a direct process in which H 2 and O 2 are reacted would be preferable. Unfortunately, catalysts for the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 are also effective for its subsequent decomposition, and this has limited their development. We show that acid pretreatment of a carbon support for gold-palladium alloy catalysts switches off the decomposition of H 2 O 2 . This treatment decreases the size of the alloy nanoparticles, and these smaller nanoparticles presumably decorate and inhibit the sites for the decomposition reaction. Hence, when used in the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 , the acid-pretreated catalysts give high yields of H 2 O 2 with hydrogen selectivities greater than 95%."

Here we show that human RBCs convert garlic-derived organic polysulfides into hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), an endogenous cardioprotective vascular cell signaling molecule. This H 2 S production, measured in real time by a novel polarographic H 2 S sensor, is supported by glucose-maintained cytosolic glutathione levels and is to a large extent reliant on reduced thiols in or on the RBC membrane. H 2 S production from organic polysulfides is facilitated by allyl substituents and by increasing numbers of tethering sulfur atoms. Allyl-substituted polysulfides undergo nucleophilic substitution at the α carbon of the allyl substituent, thereby forming a hydropolysulfide (RS n H), a key intermediate during the formation of H 2 S. Organic polysulfides (R-S n -R′; n &gt; 2) also undergo nucleophilic substitution at a sulfur atom, yielding RS n H and H 2 S. Intact aorta rings, under physiologically relevant oxygen levels, also metabolize garlic-derived organic polysulfides to liberate H 2 S. The vasoactivity of garlic compounds is synchronous with H 2 S production, and their potency to mediate relaxation increases with H 2 S yield, strongly supporting our hypothesis that H 2 S mediates the vasoactivity of garlic. Our results also suggest that the capacity to produce H 2 S can be used to standardize garlic dietary supplements."

Many hydrogen-evolving photocatalysts are active in the ultraviolet range, but ultraviolet light accounts for only 3% of the energy available in the solar spectrum at ground level. Solid-state crystalline photocatalysts have light absorption profiles that are a discrete function of their crystalline phase and that are not always tunable. Here, we prepare a series of amorphous, microporous organic polymers with exquisite synthetic control over the optical gap in the range 1.94-2.95 eV. Specific monomer compositions give polymers that are robust and effective photocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen from water in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, without the apparent need for an added metal cocatalyst. Remarkably, unlike other organic systems, the best performing polymer is only photoactive under visible rather than ultraviolet irradiation."

The focus of this Review is on elementary reactions of ions that achieve complete catalytic cycles under thermal conditions. The examples chosen cover aspects of catalysis pertinent to areas as diverse as atmospheric chemistry and surface chemistry. We describe how transfer of oxygen atoms, bond activation, and coupling of fragments can be mediated by atomic or cluster metal ions. In some cases truly unexpected analogies of the idealized gas-phase ion catalysis can be drawn with related chemical transformations in solution or the solid state, and so improve our understanding of the intrinsic operation of a practical catalyst at a strictly molecular level."

Several alternative electron transfer pathways have been postulated for the reduction of insoluble extracellular subsurface minerals, such as Fe(III) oxides, by Shewanella species. One such potential mechanism involves the secretion of an electron shuttle. Here we identify for the first time flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and riboflavin as the extracellular electron shuttles produced by a range of Shewanella species. FMN secretion was strongly correlated with growth and exceeded riboflavin secretion, which was not exclusively growth associated but was maximal in the stationary phase of batch cultures. Flavin adenine dinucleotide was the predominant intracellular flavin but was not released by live cells. The flavin yields were similar under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with total flavin concentrations of 2.9 and 2.1 micromol per gram of cellular protein, respectively, after 24 h and were similar under dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing conditions and when fumarate was supplied as the sole electron acceptor. The flavins were shown to act as electron shuttles and to promote anoxic growth coupled to the accelerated reduction of poorly crystalline Fe(III) oxides. The implications of flavin secretion by Shewanella cells living at redox boundaries, where these mineral phases can be significant electron acceptors for growth, are discussed."

Developing cheap yet durable substitutes of precious-metal catalysts, especially the bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity for both ORR and OER reactions and their streamlined coupling process, are highly desirable to reduce the processing cost and complexity of renewable energy systems. Here, a facile strategy is reported for synthesizing double-shelled hybrid nanocages with outer shells of Co-N-doped graphitic carbon (Co-NGC) and inner shells of N-doped microporous carbon (NC) by templating against core-shell metal-organic frameworks. The double-shelled NC@Co-NGC nanocages well integrate the high activity of Co-NGC shells into the robust NC hollow framework with enhanced diffusion kinetics, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic properties to Pt and RuO2 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER, and hold a promise as efficient air electrode catalysts in Zn-air batteries. First-principles calculations reveal that the high catalytic activities of Co-NGC shells are due to the synergistic electron transfer and redistribution between the Co nanoparticles, the graphitic carbon, and the doped N species. Strong yet favorable adsorption of an OOH* intermediate on the high density of uncoordinated hollow-site C atoms with respect to the Co lattice in the Co-NGC structure is a vital rate-determining step to achieve excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity."

The scope of the arylation process is broad and tolerates broad functionality on both the indole and aryl unit, which makes it amenable to further elaboration. The mechanism of the arylation reaction is proposed to proceed via a Cu(III)−aryl species that undergoes initial electrophilic addition at the C3 position of the indole motif. We speculate that site of indole arylation arises through a migration of the Cu(III)−aryl group from C3 to C2, and this can be controlled by the nature of the group on the nitrogen atom; free (NH)- and N-alkylindoles deliver the C3-arylated product, whereas N-acetylindoles afford the C2 isomer, both with excellent yield and selectivity."

These substrates are generally more expensive and less widely available than their chloride counterparts. Over the past few years, new catalytic systems with the ability to activate unreactive and sterically hindered aryl chlorides have been developed. The new catalysts are based on palladium complexes that contain electron‐rich and bulky phosphine or carbene ligands.

However, alternative metal-oxides are currently being explored that may offer advantages through ease of processing, higher electron mobility, or interface band energetics. We present here a comparative study of electron mobility and injection dynamics in thin films of TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 nanoparticles sensitized with Z907 ruthenium dye. Using time-resolved terahertz photoconductivity measurements, we show that, for ZnO and SnO2 nanoporous films, electron injection from the sensitizer has substantial slow components lasting over tens to hundreds of picoseconds, while for TiO2, the process is predominantly concluded within a few picoseconds. These results correlate well with the overall electron injection efficiencies we determine from photovoltaic cells fabricated from identical nanoporous films, suggesting that such slow components limit the overall photocurrent generated by the solar cell. We conclude that these injection dynamics are not substantially influenced by bulk energy level offsets but rather by the local environment of the dye–nanoparticle interface that is governed by dye binding modes and densities of states available for injection, both of which may vary from site to site. In addition, we have extracted the electron mobility in the three nanoporous metal-oxide films at early time after excitation from terahertz conductivity measurements and compared these with the time-averaged, long-range mobility determined for devices based on identical films. Comparison with established values for single-crystal Hall mobilities of the three materials shows that, while electron mobility values for nanoporous TiO2 films are approaching theoretical maximum values, both early time, short distance and interparticle electron mobility in nanoporous ZnO or SnO2 films offer considerable scope for improvement."

TBD is shown to polymerize LA, VL, and CL in a fast and controlled manner, whereas MTBD and DBU polymerized LA and addition of a thiourea cocatalyst led to the ROP of VL and CL being achieved. Each of the catalysts produced polymers displaying high end group fidelity, good correlation between theoretical and observed molecular weight, and linear relationships between conversion and molecular weight. The enhanced activity of TBD relative to MTBD and DBU is attributed to its bifunctionality, enabling the simultaneous activation of both the cyclic ester monomer and the alcohol group of the initiator/propagating species. Temperature-dependent NMR studies generated individual association constants for MTBD with benzyl alcohol and thiourea with VL. In combination with temperature-dependent ROP of VL in the presence of benzyl alcohol, MTBD, and thiourea, these data have led to the derivation of the activation energy for the ROP (49 ± 3 kJ mol-1). The simplicity of the reaction conditions, the ready availability of the catalysts, the variety of polymerizable cyclic ester monomers, and the exquisite control over the polymerization are demonstrated."

Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes much interest has been shown in the preparation of nanotubes of greater chemical complexity, especially, in recent times, oxide nanotubes. Progress in this field has been reviewed recently by Rao and Nath and by Nesper and co-workers.1 Of such materials, titanate nanotubes have received a great deal of attention, in part because TiO2 can exhibit a wealth of important photovoltaic (solar energy conversion), photocatalytic, semiconductor, catalytic support, and gas-sensing properties, especially when prepared as a nanomaterial.2 Nanotubes may often only be synthesized in small quantities or by processes that are too complex for scale-up and hence practical application. In contrast, titanate nanotubes and nanowires may be synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction between NaOH and the anatase polymorph of titania (TiO2-anatase).3 Until recently it was believed that such nanotubes and nanowires were composed of TiO2-anatase.4 This hypothesis was called into question by Du et al., and later work suggested that the nanotubes are composed of the layered titanate H2Ti3O7.5 Sun and Li have recently confirmed that these nanotubes are indeed titanates, not TiO2, and that as-synthesized materials can be described as NaxH2-xTi3O7 with (x=0.75).6 In addition, Yang et al. produced the formulation Na2Ti2O4(OH)2.7 We have examined the titanate nanotubes and nanowires and also find that the composition and structure of both the tubes and wires are more complex than had been recognized previously. We find that the as-synthesized nanotubes and nanowires are sodium hydrogen titanates of general formula NayH2-yTinO2n+1⋅x H2O. Acid washing of such materials results in ion exchange to produce the layered hydrogen titanates H2TinO2n+1⋅x H2O, which exhibits features similar to H2Ti3O7, H2Ti4O9⋅H2O, and other members of the hydrogen titanate family. Structures and compositions of the tubes and wires will be discussed elsewhere.8 It is known that layered hydrogen titanates may be converted to the titanium dioxide polymorph TiO2-B on heating.9 In view of this we decided to investigate the thermal behavior of the nanotubes and nanowires and have succeeded in preparing TiO2-B nanowires. Given that we now understand that previously prepared nanotubes/nanowires are NayH2-yTinO2n+1⋅x H2O or H2TinO2n+1⋅x H2O phases, this is the first synthesis of TiO2 nanowires. The synthesis is again simple, and involves a hydrothermal reaction between NaOH and TiO2, followed by acid washing and heating at 400 °C. Furthermore, TiO2-B has the advantage over the other titanium dioxide polymorphs of being a relatively open structure. As such it is an excellent host for Li intercalation, leading to nanowires that can display simultaneously n-type electronic conductivity and lithium-ion transport, with the level of each being controllable by controlling the degree of intercalation. Hence by a simple route, it is now possible to prepare relatively large quantities of single-phase TiO2 nanowires in high yield, and render them electronically and ionically conducting. Titanate nanotubes/nanowires were synthesized as described in the Experimental Section.3 Carrying out this reaction at around 150 °C with a 10 M NaOH solution yields nanotubes, whereas higher temperatures and/or higher NaOH concentrations yields nanowires. Washing the tubes or wires with dilute HCl promotes complete exchange of Na+ by H+ to form hydrogen titanates. On heating the tubes, they convert to anatase but with the loss of the tubular morphology. In contrast the wires behave quite differently; after washing with dilute acid and heating they convert to TiO2-B but retain their cylindrical morphology. This begins at 200 °C, as observed by variable-temperature X-ray diffraction (Figure 1). Annealing a sample of the acid-washed wires at 400 °C for 4 h in air produces a material which gives the powder diffraction pattern shown in Figure 2. Although the diffraction peaks associated with the nanowires are somewhat broadened they match the pattern for TiO2-B. Further confirmation that the nanowires are composed of TiO2-B was obtained from Raman spectroscopy. Figure 3 shows a spectrum of the wires, annealed as described above, compared with a spectrum for bulk TiO2-B. Although the spectrum obtained is somewhat broadened there is an excellent match with that obtained from bulk TiO2-B.

I=intensity. Raman spectra for TiO2-B nanowires (—) and, for comparison, bulk TiO2-B (- - - -). I=intensity. Evidence that the nanowires have retained their morphology is shown in Figure 4. The low-resolution TEM image (Figure 4 a) indicates the presence of a high proportion of nanowires with a typical diameter of 20–40 nm and a length of 2–10 μm. At higher magnification the HRTEM lattice images reveal more detail concerning the TiO2-B structure of the nanowires (Figure 4 b). By measuring the lattice fringes and from the electron diffraction patterns taken along different zone axes, the lattice parameters were found to be in agreement with those for the bulk TiO2-B phase (a=12.1787, b=3.7412, c=6.5249 Å; β=107.054°).9b EDX confirmed the absence of sodium from the TiO2-B nanowires. a) Low-resolution TEM image of the TiO2-B nanowires; b) high-resolution lattice image viewed down the [100] projection (inset: electron diffraction pattern of a TiO2-B nanowire). The TiO2-B nanowires are white and insulating, however, given the ability of bulk TiO2-B to act as an intercalation host for Li, we investigated the possibility of inserting Li+ and e− into the nanowires, in order to render them ionically and electronically conducting, the latter an n-type semiconductor due to the reduction of Ti4+ centers. To demonstrate lithium intercalation, a working electrode was fabricated by grinding together TiO2-B nanowires and Super-S carbon with a PTFE binder and then pressing a disk (also see Experimental Section). The variation of the voltage versus a (1 M) Li+/Li electrode, as a function of the charge passed is shown in Figure 5. The voltage curve on intercalation (discharging) and deintercalation (charging) is smoother than the corresponding curve collected under identical conditions for bulk TiO2-B. However the voltages of the charge/discharge plateaux are very similar, which indicates similar energetics for the intercalation reactions. The capacity of the TiO2-B nanowires to intercalate Li is high, corresponding to 275 mA h g−1 and a composition of Li0.82TiO2. X-ray diffraction patterns and TEM data collected at the end of the charging process confirmed the retention of the TiO2-B structure and the nanowire morphology. This experiment clearly demonstrates the ability of the TiO2-B nanowires to support both Li+ and e− conductivity. It also demonstrates that this material may be of interest as a negative (low-voltage) electrode in lithium-ion batteries. Further confirmation that lithium may be intercalated into the nanowires was obtained by carrying out a chemical intercalation reaction using n-butyl lithium. The white solid turns blue/black, and the X-ray diffraction pattern again indicates retention of the TiO2-B structure. Variation of potential (versus a 1 m Li+/Li electrode) with Li content (charge passed) for TiO2-B nanowires (—) and bulk TiO2-B (- - - -) cycled under identical conditions. Rate: 10 mA g−1 (10 mA of charge passed per gram of TiO2-B); voltage limits: +1 and +3 V. V=potential. In conclusion, it has been shown that titanate nanotubes lose their tubular morphology on heating and form TiO2-anatase whereas the corresponding nanowires retain their morphology and convert to TiO2-B. Li+ ions and e− may be inserted into the TiO2-B nanowires, rendering them ionically and electronically conducting, and then subsequently removed. Titanate nanotubes were synthesized by adding TiO2-anatase to a 10 M aqueous solution of NaOH. After stirring for 1 h the resulting suspension was transferred to a teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 150 °C for 72 h. The product was acid-washed, which involved stirring the sample in 0.05 M HCl solution for 2 h. The material was then filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 80 °C for 15 h. To synthesize titanate nanowires, a similar procedure was followed but using 15 M NaOH solution and a reaction temperature of 170 °C. TiO2-B nanowires were prepared by heating the acid-washed titanate nanowires at 400 °C for 4 h in air. Room-temperature powder X-ray diffraction was performed on a Stoe STADI/P diffractometer operating in transmission mode with CuKα1 radiation. Variable-temperature measurements were carried out on a Philips X'Pert system (CuKα radiation) in Bragg-Brentano geometry fitted with a Bühler high-temperature stage. Raman spectra were obtained from disks, formed by pressing powders, on a Perkin-Elmer System 2000. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on a Jeol JEM-2011 instrument fitted with an EDX facility. Electrochemical properties were measured on electrodes prepared using mixtures comprising 75 % active material, 18 % Super-S carbon and 7 wt % PTFE, pressed into pellets. The cells consisted of this electrode, a lithium metal counterelectrode and the electrolyte, a 1 M solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1 v/v; Merck). The cells were constructed and handled in an Ar-filled MBraun glovebox. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Biologic MacPile II system.

The physical properties of choline chloride mixtures with glycerol are quantified and it is shown that eutectic mixtures can circumvent some of the difficulties of using glycerol as a solvent viz. high viscosity and high melting point. The solvent properties are characterised using polarity parameters and the values are similar to other ionic liquids although it is shown that this procedure is a poor method of characterising Lewis basicity. The application of these liquids to the esterification of glycerol is used as a demonstration of the ability to tune a reaction with the quaternary ammonium halide acting as a quasi-protecting group. The liquids represent a sustainable way of preparing non-toxic, tuneable solvent systems."

For catalytic applications, metal particles are generally formed on an oxide support by physical or chemical deposition, or less commonly by exsolution from it. Although fundamentally different, both methods might be assumed to produce morphologically and functionally similar particles. Here we show that unlike nickel particles deposited on perovskite oxides, exsolved analogues are socketed into the parent perovskite, leading to enhanced stability and a significant decrease in the propensity for hydrocarbon coking, indicative of a stronger metal-oxide interface. In addition, we reveal key surface effects and defect interactions critical for future design of exsolution-based perovskite materials for catalytic and other functionalities. This study provides a new dimension for tailoring particle-substrate interactions in the context of increasing interest for emergent interfacial phenomena."

The development of low‐cost, highly efficient and stable bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts is critical for a large‐scale application of this technology. In this review, the authors first introduce the fundamentals of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. Various types of nanostructured materials as bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts including metal oxide, hydroxide and sulfide, functional carbon material, metal, and their composites are then reviewed. The crucial factors that can be used to tune the activity of the catalyst towards ORR/OER are summarized, including (1) phase, morphology, crystal facet, defect, mixed‐metal and strain engineering for metal oxide; (2) heteroatom doping, topological defects, and formation of metal‐N‐C structure for carbon material; (3) alloy effect for metal. These experiences lay the foundation for large scale application of metal‐air battery and can also effectively guide the rational design of catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions."

The possible mechanisms of nanotube formation are reviewed and a mechanism based on the key stage of wrapping of intermediate multilayered titanate nanosheets is suggested. The driving force for wrapping is considered to be the mechanical stress arising during crystallisation/dissolution. The average diameter of the nanotubes was found to depend on the temperature and on the ratio of weight of TiO2 to the volume of sodium hydroxide solution. An increase in the temperature from 120 to 150 °C results in an increase in the average nanotube diameter. Subsequent increases in the temperature result in the formation of non-hollow TiO2 nanofibers with an average diameter of 75 nm, a wide distribution in diameter and a length in excess of 10 µm. The increase of the TiO2 : NaOH molar ratio results in an increase in the average diameter of nanotubes and a decrease of surface area. The average inner diameter of TiO2 nanotubes varied between 2 and 10 nm. The pore-size distribution was evaluated from TEM, and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption data using the BJH method. It was shown that nitrogen adsorption is a suitable method for characterisation of the pore morphology of nanotubes."

Since it was synthesized in 1834, g-C3N4 has been extensively studied both catalytically and structurally. Although its 2D structure seems to have been solved, its 3D crystal structure has not yet been confirmed. This study attempts to solve the 3D structure of graphitic carbon nitride by means of X-ray diffraction and of neutron scattering. Initially, various structural models are considered and their XRD patterns compared to the measured one. After selecting possible candidates as g-C3N4 structure, neutron scattering is employed to identify the best model that describes the 3D structure of graphitic carbon nitride. Parallel chains of tri-s-triazine units organized in layers with an A–B stacking motif are found to describe the structure of the synthesized graphitic carbon nitride well. A misalignment of the layers is favorable because of the decreased π–π repulsive interlayer interactions."

However, not all of the ions present appear to be available to participate in conduction processes, to a degree that is dependent on the nature of the ionic liquid and its structure. There is much interest in quantifying and understanding this 'degree of ionicity' phenomenon. In this paper we present transport data for a range of ionic liquids and evaluate the data firstly in terms of the Walden plot as an approximate and readily accessible approach to estimating ionicity. An adjusted Walden plot that makes explicit allowance for differences in ion sizes is shown to be an improvement to this approach for the series of ionic liquids described. In some cases, where diffusion measurements are possible, it is feasible to directly quantify ionicity via the Nernst-Einstein equation, confirming the validity of the adjusted Walden plot approach. Some of the ionic liquids studied exhibit ionicity values very close to ideal; this is discussed in terms of a model of a highly associated liquid in which the ion correlations have similar impact on both the diffusive and conductive motions. Ionicity, as defined, is thus a useful measure of adherence to the Nernst-Einstein equation, but is not necessarily a measure of ion availability in the chemical sense."

Analysis by both x-ray crystallography and pre-steady-state kinetics revealed an equilibrium between different preexisting isomers, one of which possessed a promiscuous, low-affinity binding site for aromatic ligands, including the immunizing hapten. A subsequent induced-fit isomerization led to high-affinity complexes with a deep and narrow binding site. A protein antigen identified by repertoire selection made use of an unrelated antibody isomer with a wide, shallow binding site. Conformational diversity, whereby one sequence adopts multiple structures and multiple functions, can increase the effective size of the antibody repertoire but may also lead to autoimmunity and allergy."

Furthermore, GQDs are environmentally friendly due to its non-toxic and biologically inert properties, which have attracted worldwide interests from academic and industry. In this review, a number of GQDs preparation methods, such as hydrothermal method, microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, soft-template method, liquid exfoliation method, metal-catalyzed method and electron beam lithography method etc., are summarized. Their structural, morphological, chemical composition, optical, electrical and optoelectrical properties have been characterized and studied.

The control of its size and shape has been realized by means of preparation parameters, such as synthesis temperature, growth time, source concentration and catalyst etc. As far as energy level engineering is concerned, the elemental doping has shown an introduction of energy level in GQDs which may tune the optical, electrical and optoelectrical properties of the GQDs. The applications of GQDs in biological imaging, optoelectrical detectors, solar cells, light emitting diodes, fluorescent agent, photocatalysis, and lithium ion battery are described.

Herein, we report a novel amide-containing receptor for Zn2+, combined with a naphthalimide fluorophore, termed ZTRS. The fluorescence, absorption detection, NMR, and IR studies indicated that ZTRS bound Zn2+ in an imidic acid tautomeric form of the amide/di-2-picolylamine receptor in aqueous solution, while most other HTM ions were bound to the sensor in an amide tautomeric form. Due to this differential binding mode, ZTRS showed excellent selectivity for Zn2+ over most competitive HTM ions with an enhanced fluorescence (22-fold) as well as a red-shift in emission from 483 to 514 nm. Interestingly, the ZTRS/Cd2+ complex showed an enhanced (21-fold) blue-shift in emission from 483 to 446 nm. Therefore, ZTRS discriminated in vitro and in vivo Zn2+ and Cd2+ with green and blue fluorescence, respectively. Due to the stronger affinity, Zn2+ could be ratiometrically detected in vitro and in vivo with a large emission wavelength shift from 446 to 514 nm via a Cd2+ displacement approach. ZTRS was also successfully used to image intracellular Zn2+ ions in the presence of iron ions. Finally, we applied ZTRS to detect zinc ions during the development of living zebrafish embryos."

The effects of different starting N : Ti atomic ratios on the catalysts structure, surface property and catalytic activity have been investigated. The photocatalytic activity and stability of the N-doped TiO2 samples were evaluated through using the decomposition of Methylene blue (MB) and Methyl orange (MO) as model reaction under visible light irradiation. Characterization results show that the nitrogen dopant has a significant effect on the crystallite size and optical absorption of TiO2. It was found that the N-doped TiO2 catalysts have enhanced absorption in the visible light region, and exhibit higher activity for photocatalytic degradation of model dyes (e.g. MB and MO). The catalyst with the highest performance was the one prepared using N : Ti molar ratio of 1.0. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement suggests the materials contain Ti3+ ions, with both the degree of N doping and oxygen vacancies make contributions to the visible light absorption of TON. The presence of superoxide radicals (O˙−) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) on the surface of TON were found to be responsible for MB and MO solution decoloration under visible light. Based on the results of the present study, a visible light induced photocatalytic mechanism has been proposed for N-doped anatase TiO2."

The approach combines the inertness of Au nanoparticles toward oxidation, with the improved O2 sticking probability of isolated transition metal ""guest"" atoms embedded in the Au ""host"". DFT modeling was employed to screen for the best alloy candidates. Modeling indicates that isolated alloying atoms of Pd, Pt, or Rh placed within the Au surface should enhance the H2O2 production relative to pure Au. Consequently, Au1–xPdx nanoalloys with variable Pd content supported on Vulcan XC-72 were prepared to investigate the predicted selectivity toward H2O2 production for Au alloyed with Pd. It is demonstrated that increasing the Pd concentration to 8% leads to an increase of the electrocatalytic H2O2 production selectivity up to nearly 95%, when the nanoparticles are placed in an environment compatible with that of a proton exchange membrane. Further increase of Pd content leads to a drop in H2O2 selectivity, to below 10% for x = 0.5. It is proposed that the enhancement in H2O2 selectivity is caused by the presence of individual surface Pd atoms surrounded by gold, whereas surface ensembles of contiguous Pd atoms support H2O formation. The results are discussed in the context of exergonic electrocatalytic H2O2 synthesis in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells for the simultaneous cogeneration of chemicals and electricity, the latter a credit to production costs."

Here we introduce a recyclable redox mediator (silicotungstic acid) that enables the coupling of low-pressure production of oxygen via water oxidation to a separate, catalytic hydrogen production step outside the electrolyzer that requires no post-electrolysis energy input. This approach sidesteps the production of high-pressure gases inside the electrolytic cell (a major cause of membrane degradation) and essentially eliminates the hazardous issue of product gas crossover at the low current densities that characterize renewables-driven water-splitting devices.

With a series of MnCo2 O4 , the Mn in octahedral sites is identified as an active site.

Transition metal carbonyls have been recently shown to function as carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CO-RMs) and to elicit distinct pharmacological activities in biological systems. In the present study, we report that a water-soluble form of CO-RM promotes cardioprotection in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we found that tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)ruthenium(II) (CORM-3) is stable in water at acidic pH but in physiological buffers rapidly liberates CO in solution. Cardiac cells pretreated with CORM-3 (10 to 50 micromol/L) become more resistant to the damage caused by hypoxia-reoxygenation and oxidative stress. In addition, isolated hearts reperfused in the presence of CORM-3 (10 micromol/L) after an ischemic event displayed a significant recovery in myocardial performance and a marked and significant reduction in cardiac muscle damage and infarct size. The cardioprotective effects mediated by CORM-3 in cardiac cells and isolated hearts were totally abolished by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channels. Predictably, cardioprotection is lost when CORM-3 is replaced by an inactive form (iCORM-3) that is incapable of liberating CO. Using a model of cardiac allograft rejection in mice, we also found that treatment of recipients with CORM-3 but not iCORM-3 considerably prolonged the survival rate of transplanted hearts. These data corroborate the notion that transition metal carbonyls could be used as carriers to deliver CO and highlight the bioactivity and potential therapeutic features of CO-RMs in the mitigation of cardiac dysfunction.

The effect of treatment temperature on the types of nitrogen functionalities introduced was evaluated by synchrotron based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while the impact of the preparation methods on the surface acid-base properties was investigated by potentiometric titration, microcalorimetry, and zeta potential measurements. The impact of the N-functionalization on the electronic properties was measured by THz-Time Domain spectroscopy. The samples functionalized via amination are characterized by the coexistence of acidic and basic O and N sites. The population of O and N species is temperature dependent. In particular, at 873 K nitrogen is stabilized in substitutional positions within the graphitic structure, as heterocyclic-like moieties. The surface presents heterogeneously distributed and energetically different basic sites. A small amount of strong basic sites gives rise to a differential heat of CO(2) adsorption of 150 kJ mol(-1). However, when functionalization is carried out at 473 K, nitrogen moieties with basic character are introduced and the maximum heat of adsorption is significantly lower, at approximately 90 kJ mol(-1). In the latter sample, energetically different basic sites coexist with acidic oxygen groups introduced during the oxidative step. Under these conditions, a bifunctional acidic and basic surface is obtained with high hydrophilic character. N-functionalization carried out at higher temperature changes the electronic properties of the CNFs as evaluated by THz-TDS. The functionalization procedure presented in this work allows high versatility and flexibility in tailoring the surface chemistry of nanocarbon material to specific needs. This work shows the potential of the N-containing nanocarbon materials obtained via amination in catalysis as well as electronic device materials."

It is possible to discriminate between each of the isomers including those for which commercial standards are not available. For diCQA, the ease of removal of the caffeoyl residue during fragmentation is 1 approximately = 5 > 3 > 4. The distinctive fragmentation observed for the little-studied 1,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid involves elimination of the C1 caffeoyl residue, repeated dehydrations leading to the aromatization of the quinic acid moiety, and its decarboxylation. It is suggested that this process is initiated by the C1 carboxyl protonating the C5 hydroxyl in the inverted chair conformer, followed by its protonating the C1 caffeoyl residue in the favored chair conformation. The fragmentation of 1-caffeoylquinic acid is indistinguishable from that of the commercially available 5-caffeoylquinic acid, but these two isomers can be distinguished easily by their facile chromatographic resolution on reversed phase packings. The hierarchical key previously developed for characterizing chlorogenic acids has been extended to accommodate 1-caffeoylquinic acid and the 1-acyl dicaffeoylquinic acids."

Anthropogenic climate change is projected to lead to ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation, reductions in near-surface nutrients, and changes to primary production, all of which are expected to affect marine ecosystems. Here we assess projections of these drivers of environmental change over the twenty-first century from Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) that were forced under the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Projections are compared to those from the previous generation (CMIP5) forced under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). A total of 10 CMIP5 and 13 CMIP6 models are used in the two multi-model ensembles. Under the high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5, the multi-model global mean change (2080–2099 mean values relative to 1870–1899) ± the inter-model SD in sea surface temperature, surface pH, subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen concentration, euphotic (0–100 m) nitrate concentration, and depth-integrated primary production is +3.47±0.78 ∘C, -0.44±0.005, -13.27±5.28, -1.06±0.45 mmol m−3 and -2.99±9.11 %, respectively. Under the low-emission, high-mitigation scenario SSP1-2.6, the corresponding global changes are +1.42±0.32 ∘C, -0.16±0.002, -6.36±2.92, -0.52±0.23 mmol m−3, and -0.56±4.12 %. Projected exposure of the marine ecosystem to these drivers of ocean change depends largely on the extent of future emissions, consistent with previous studies. The ESMs in CMIP6 generally project greater warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and nitrate reductions but lesser primary production declines than those from CMIP5 under comparable radiative forcing. The increased projected ocean warming results from a general increase in the climate sensitivity of CMIP6 models relative to those of CMIP5. This enhanced warming increases upper-ocean stratification in CMIP6 projections, which contributes to greater reductions in upper-ocean nitrate and subsurface oxygen ventilation. The greater surface acidification in CMIP6 is primarily a consequence of the SSPs having higher associated atmospheric CO2 concentrations than their RCP analogues for the same radiative forcing. We find no consistent reduction in inter-model uncertainties, and even an increase in net primary production inter-model uncertainties in CMIP6, as compared to CMIP5."

Hybrid solar cells based on light absorbing semiconducting polymers infiltrated into mesoporous TiO2 are an interesting concept, but generating charge at the polymer–metal oxide heterojunction is challenging. Metal–organic perovskite absorbers have recently shown remarkable efficiencies but currently lack the range of color tunability of organics. Here, we have combined a fullerene self-assembled monolayer (C60SAM) functionalized mesoporous titania, a perovskite absorber (CH3NH3PbI3–xClx), and a light absorbing polymer hole-conductor, P3HT, to realize a 6.7% efficient hybrid solar cell. We find that photoexcitations in both the perovskite and the polymer undergo very efficient electron transfer to the C60SAM. The C60SAM acts as an electron acceptor but inhibits further electron transfer into the TiO2 mesostructure due to energy level misalignment and poor electronic coupling. Thermalized electrons from the C60SAM are then transported through the perovskite phase. This strategy allows a reduction of energy loss, while still employing a ""mesoporous electron acceptor"", representing an exciting and versatile route forward for hybrid photovoltaics incorporating light-absorbing polymers. Finally, we show that we can use the C60SAM functionalization of mesoporous TiO2 to achieve an 11.7% perovskite-sensitized solar cell using Spiro-OMeTAD as a transparent hole transporter."

From the early use of inorganic salts such as AuCl and AuCl3 as catalysts, the field has evolved to explore ligands that fine-tune reactivity, stability, and, more recently, selectivity in gold-mediated processes. Substrates generally contain alkenes or alkynes, and they usually involve straightforward protocols in air with solvents that can oftentimes be of technical grade. The actual catalytic species is the putative cationic gold(I) complex [Au(L)]+ (where L is a phosphorus-based species or N-heterocyclic carbene, NHC). The early gold systems bearing phosphine and phosphite ligands provided important transformations and served as useful mechanistic probes. More recently, the use of NHCs as ligands for gold has rapidly gained in popularity. These two-electron donor ligands combine strong σ-donating properties with a steric profile that allows for both stabilization of the metal center and enhancement of its catalytic activity. As a result, the gold−NHC complexes have been used as well-defined precatalysts and have permitted the isolation of reactive single-component systems that are now used instead of the initial [Au(L)Cl]/silver salt method. Because some are now commercially available, NHC-containing gold(I) complexes are gathering increasing interest.In this Account, we describe the chronological development of this chemistry in our laboratories, highlighting the advantages of this family of gold complexes and reviewing their synthesis and applications in catalysis. We first outline the syntheses, which are straightforward. The complexes generally exhibit high stability, allowing for indefinite storage and easy handling. We next consider catalysis, particularly examining efficacy in cycloisomerization, other skeletal rearrangements, addition of water to alkynes and nitriles, and C−H bond activation. These processes are quite atom-economical, and in the most recent C−H reactions the only byproduct is water. State-of-the-art methodology now involves single-component catalysts, precluding the need for costly silver co-catalysts. Remarkably, the use of an NHC as a supporting ligand has permitted the isolation of [Au(L)(S)]+ species (where S is a solvent molecule such as a nitrile), which can act as single-component catalysts. Some improvements are still needed, as the single components are most often synthesized with a silver reagent. Owing to the stabilizing effect of NHC coordination, some NHC-containing systems can catalyze extremely challenging reactions (at temperatures as high as 140 °C) and react at very low loadings of gold (ppm levels). Our latest developments deal with C−H bond functionalization and hold great promise.We close with a selection of important developments by the community with gold−NHC complexes. As demonstrated by the turns and twists encountered during our own journey in the gold−NHC venture, the chemistry described here, combining fundamental organometallic, catalytic, and organic methodology, remains rich in opportunities, especially considering that only a handful of gold(I) architectures has been studied. We hope this Account will encourage young researchers to explore this emerging area, as the adage ""the more you do, the more you have to do"" surely holds true in gold-mediated catalysis."

Layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based nanomaterials are considered as promising electrocatalysts for OER. However, the stacking structure of LDHs limits the exposure of the active sites. Therefore, the exfoliation is necessary to expose more active sites. In addition, the defect engineering is proved to be an efficient strategy to enhance the performance of OER electrocatalysts. For the first time, this study prepares ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets with multivacancies as OER electrocatalysts by water-plasma-enabled exfoliation. The water plasma can destroy the electrostatic interactions between the host metal layers and the interlayer cations, resulting in the fast exfoliation. On the other hand, the etching effect of plasma can simultaneously and effectively produce multivacancies in the as-exfoliated ultrathin LDHs nanosheets. The increased active sites and the multivacancies significantly contribute to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER. Compared to pristine CoFe LDHs, the as-exfoliated ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity for OER with a ultralow overpotential of only 232 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and possesses outstanding kinetics (the Tafel slope of 36 mV dec-1 ). This work provides a novel strategy to exfoliate LDHs and to produce multivacancies simultaneously as highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER."

Typical antibacterial materials involve the use of biocides and antibacterial metallic ions, such as Ag+, as well as killing by highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide produced by the photocatalysis of TiO2. However, the intensive usage of biocides has a growing concern in the increase of bacterial resistance and cross-resistance to antibiotics and antibacterial Ag+ depending on its dissolution property may have potential implications on human health and environment. Currently TiO2 is mainly activated with UVA light and research on visible light photocatalysis is still under development. Recently, a new scheme using superhydrophobicity has raised more attention and interests especially for its ability in reducing bacterial adhesion. This paper provides a detailed review on the basics, recent developments, existing challenges and future perspectives of superhydrophobic surfaces especially in reducing bacterial adhesion."

Recent progress in gasification techniques and key generation pathways for biofuels production, process design and integration and socio-environmental impacts of biofuel generation are discussed, with the goal of investigating gasification-to-biofuels’ credentials as a sustainable and eco-friendly technology. The synthesis of important biofuels such as bio-methanol, bio-ethanol and higher alcohols, bio-dimethyl ether, Fischer Tropsch fuels, bio-methane, bio-hydrogen and algae-based fuels is reviewed, together with recent technologies, catalysts and reactors. Significant thermodynamic studies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for biofuel production, and innovative pathways such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik, Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The conversion of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels. Bio-methane has emerged as a lucrative alternative for conventional transportation fuel with all the advantages of natural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. Routes to produce H2 are discussed, though critical issues such as storage, expensive production routes with low efficiencies remain. Algae-based fuels are in the research and development stage, but are shown to have immense potential to become commercially important because of their capability to fix large amounts of CO2, to rapidly grow in many environments and versatile end uses. However, suitable process configurations resulting in optimal plant designs are crucial, so detailed process integration is a powerful tool to optimize current and develop new processes. LCA and ethical issues are also discussed in brief. It is clear that the use of food crops, as opposed to food wastes represents an area fraught with challenges, which must be resolved on a case by case basis."

Conventional supported monometallic Pd catalysts offer high acetylene conversion, but they suffer from very low selectivity to ethylene due to overhydrogenation and the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Herein, a series of Ag alloyed Pd single-atom catalysts, possessing only ppm levels of Pd, supported on silica gel were prepared by a simple incipient wetness coimpregnation method and applied to the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in an ethylene-rich stream under conditions close to the front-end employed by industry. High acetylene conversion and simultaneous selectivity to ethylene was attained over a wide temperature window, surpassing an analogous Au alloyed Pd single-atom system we previously reported. Restructuring of AgPd nanoparticles and electron transfer from Ag to Pd were evidenced by in situ FTIR and in situ XPS as a function of increasing reduction temperature. Microcalorimetry and XANES measurements support both geometric and electronic synergetic effects between the alloyed Pd and Ag. Kinetic studies provide valuable insight into the nature of the active sites within these AgPd/SiO2 catalysts, and hence, they provide evidence for the key factors underpinning the excellent performance of these bimetallic catalysts toward the selective hydrogenation of acetylene under ethylene-rich conditions while minimizing precious metal usage."

However, limitations in the conditions originally described have meant that this reaction has achieved less prominence than the coupling reaction that also bears his name. Nevertheless, the attractiveness of this chemistry for forming carbonyl derivatives has led many researchers over the intervening years to attempt to increase the scope of the reaction beyond the originally described bromide, iodide, and triflate substrates, with conditions suited to large-scale application (particularly low pressure). To a large degree, this has now been achieved. This review describes the progress made regarding the selection of catalysts and conditions for this set of reactions, including illustrations from our own research. Reactions can now be carried out with aryl chlorides and tosylates bearing a range of substituents affecting both the electronic and steric properties of the substrate. The complexities of the reaction, represented by the interplay of catalyst, CO pressure, temperature, base, and solvent, make parallel screening desirable for optimization studies."

N2 reduction to NH3 is essential to the chemical industry and to the Earth's nitrogen cycle. Industrially, NH3 is synthesized by the Haber-Bosch process under extreme conditions (400-500 °C, 200-250 bar), stimulating research into the development of sustainable technologies for NH3 production. Herein, this study demonstrates that ultrathin layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) photocatalysts, in particular CuCr-LDH nanosheets, possess remarkable photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of N2 to NH3 in water at 25 °C under visible-light irradiation. The excellent activity can be attributed to the severely distorted structure and compressive strain in the LDH nanosheets, which significantly enhances N2 chemisorption and thereby promotes NH3 formation."

A major bottleneck toward developing artificial photosynthesis with TiO2 is that it only absorbs ultraviolet light, owing to its large bandgap of 3.2 eV. If one could reduce the bandgap of anatase to the visible region, TiO2-based photocatalysis could become a competitive clean energy source. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, we report the discovery of a highly reactive titanium-terminated anatase surface with a reduced bandgap of less than 2 eV, stretching into the red portion of the solar spectrum. By tuning the surface preparation conditions, we can reversibly switch between the standard anatase surface and the newly discovered low bandgap surface phase. The identification of a TiO2 anatase surface phase with a bandgap in the visible and high chemical reactivity has important implications for solar energy conversion, photocatalysis, and artificial photosynthesis."

Intercalation of ions into MXenes has recently been demonstrated with good electrochemical performance, making them viable electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. Here we have performed global screening of the capacity and voltage for a variety of intercalation ions (Li(+), Na(+), K(+), and Mg(2+)) into a large number of M2C-based compounds (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta) with F-, H-, O-, and OH-functionalized surfaces using density functional theory methods. In terms of gravimetric capacity a greater amount of Li(+) or Mg(2+) can be intercalated into an MXene than Na(+) or K(+), which is related to the size of the intercalating ion. Variation of the surface functional group and transition metal species can significantly affect the voltage and capacity of an MXene, with oxygen termination leading to the highest capacity. The most promising group of M2C materials in terms of anode voltage and gravimetric capacity (>400 mAh/g) are compounds containing light transition metals (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, and Cr) with nonfunctionalized or O-terminated surfaces. The results presented here provide valuable insights into exploring a rich variety of high-capacity MXenes for potential battery applications."

The measured spectrum assignment is assisted by DFT simulations of the Raman spectra of suitable periodic and model systems. The bands at 62 and 94 cm(-1) are assigned respectively to the bending and to the stretching of the Pb-I bonds, and are thus diagnostic modes of the inorganic cage. We also assign the librations of the organic cations at 119 and 154 cm(-1). The broad, unstructured 200-400 cm(-1) features are assigned to the torsional mode of the methylammonium cations, which we propose as a marker of the orientational disorder of the material.

Boronic acid based receptor designs originated when Lorand and Edwards used the pH drop observed upon the addition of saccharides to boronic acids to determine their association constants. The inherent acidity of the boronic acid is enhanced when 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,4-diols react with boronic acids to form cyclic boronic esters (5, 6, or 7 membered rings) in aqueous media, and these interactions form the cornerstone of diol-based receptors used in the construction of sensors and separation systems.In addition, the recognition of saccharides through boronic acid complex (or boronic ester) formation often relies on an interaction between a Lewis acidic boronic acid and a Lewis base (proximal tertiary amine or anion). These properties of boronic acids have led to them being exploited in sensing and separation systems for anions (Lewis bases) and saccharides (diols).The fast and stable bond formation between boronic acids and diols to form boronate esters can serve as the basis for forming reversible molecular assemblies. In spite of the stability of the boronate esters' covalent B–O bonds, their formation is reversible under certain conditions or under the action of certain external stimuli.The reversibility of boronate ester formation and Lewis acid–base interactions has also resulted in the development and use of boronic acids within multicomponent systems. The dynamic covalent functionality of boronic acids with structure-directing potential has led researchers to develop a variety of self-organizing systems including macrocycles, cages, capsules, and polymers.This Account gives an overview of research published about boronic acids over the last 5 years. We hope that this Account will inspire others to continue the work on boronic acids and reversible covalent chemistry."

The zeolite-like carbons are prepared via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 800 or 850 °C using zeolite β as solid template and acetonitrile as carbon precursor. The zeolite-like structural ordering of the carbon materials is indicated by powder XRD patterns with at least two well-resolved diffraction peaks and TEM images that reveal well-ordered micropore channels. The carbons possess surface area of up to 3200 m2/g and pore volume of up to 2.41 cm3/g. A significant proportion of the porosity in the carbons (up to 76% and 56% for surface area and pore volume, respectively) is from micropores. Both TEM and nitrogen sorption data indicate that porosity is dominated by pores of size 0.6−0.8 nm. The carbon materials exhibit enhanced (and reversible) hydrogen storage capacity, with measured uptake of up to 6.9 wt % and estimated maximum of 8.33 wt % at −196 °C and 20 bar. At 1 bar, hydrogen uptake capacity as high as 2.6 wt % is achieved. Isosteric heat of adsorption of 8.2 kJ/mol indicates a favorable interaction between hydrogen and the surface of the carbons. The hydrogen uptake capacity observed for the zeolite-like carbon materials is among the highest ever reported for carbon (activated carbon, mesoporous carbon, CNTs) or any other (MOFs, zeolites) porous material."

It is accepted that the key is the development of a high-performance catalyst that significantly enhances dissociation of the nitrogen–nitrogen triple bond, which is generally considered a rate-determining step. Here we examine kinetics of nitrogen and hydrogen isotope exchange and hydrogen adsorption/desorption reactions for a recently discovered efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis—ruthenium-loaded 12CaO·7Al 2 O 3 electride (Ru/C12A7:e − )—and find that the rate controlling step of ammonia synthesis over Ru/C12A7:e − is not dissociation of the nitrogen–nitrogen triple bond but the subsequent formation of N–H n species. A mechanism of ammonia synthesis involving reversible storage and release of hydrogen atoms on the Ru/C12A7:e − surface is proposed on the basis of observed hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics."

As the structure is significantly altered, even at low hydration levels, reporting the DES water content is important. However, the DES nanostructure is retained to a remarkably high level of water (ca. 42 wt % H2 O) because of solvophobic sequestration of water into nanostructured domains around cholinium cations. At 51 wt %/83 mol % H2 O, this segregation becomes unfavorable, and the DES structure is disrupted; instead, water-water and DES-water interactions dominate. At and above this hydration level, the DES-water mixture is best described as an aqueous solution of DES components."

We find that these injection dynamics are independent of presence of iodide/triiodide redox couple and of the pH of the peptization step used in the synthesis of the TiO(2) nanoparticles. They are furthermore found to be only weakly dependent upon the application of electrical bias to the device. In contrast, we find these dynamics to be strongly dependent upon the concentration of tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and lithium cations in the electrolyte. This dependence is correlated with shifts of the TiO(2) conduction band energetics as a function of tBP and Li(+) concentration, from which we conclude that a 100 meV shift in band edge results in an approximately 2-fold retardation of injection dynamics. We find that the electron injection quantum yield determined from these transient emission data as a function of tBP and Li(+) concentration shows a linear correlation with device short circuit density J(sc). We thus conclude that the relative energetics of the dye excited state versus the titanium dioxide acceptor state is a key determinant of the dynamics of electron injection in DSSC, and that variations in these energetics, and therefore in the kinetics and efficiency of electron injection, impact directly upon device photovoltaic efficiency. Finally, we discuss these results in terms of singlet versus triplet electron injection pathways and the concept of minimization of kinetic redundancy."

These systems demonstrate the scope of encapsulation in the molecular engineering of optoelectronic materials and organic semiconductors. This Review surveys the synthesis and structural characterization of IMWs, and highlights emerging structure-property relationships to determine how insulation can enhance the behavior of a molecular wire. We focus mainly on three IMW architectures: polyrotaxanes, polymer-wrapped pi systems, and dendronized polymers, and compare the properties of these systems with those of conjugated polymers threaded through mesoporous frameworks and zeolites. Encapsulation of molecular wires can enhance properties as diverse as luminescence, electrical transport, and chemical stability, which points to applications in electroluminescent displays, sensors, and the photochemical generation of hydrogen."

The efficiency of these processes depends greatly on the availability of cost‐effective catalysts with high selectivity, activity, and stability. In recent years, various novel nanostructured materials have been reported to selectively produce H 2 O 2 . Through combined experimental and theoretical approaches, underlying mechanisms in the electrochemical synthesis of H 2 O 2 via oxygen electrochemistry have been unveiled. Considering the remarkable progress in this area, the authors summarize recent developments regarding the direct production of H 2 O 2 through two‐electron electrochemical oxygen reactions. The fundamental aspects of electrochemical oxygen reactions are first introduced. Various types of catalysts that can effectively produce H 2 O 2 via two‐electron oxygen electrochemistry are then presented. In parallel, the unique structure‐, component‐, and composition‐dependent electrochemical performance together with the underlying catalytic mechanisms are discussed. Finally, a brief conclusion about the recent progress achieved in electrochemical generation of H 2 O 2 and an outlook on future research challenges are given."

Engineering an efficient, low-cost photocatalyst is necessary to achieve this technological goal. A photocatalyst combines a photosensitiser and an electrocatalyst to capture light and accelerate the chemical reactions in the same device. In this perspective paper, we first describe the recent developments of some families of semiconductors that are attractive candidates for engineering photocatalysts. We then discuss the use of semiconductors as light harvesting agents, combined with a bio-catalyst, synthetic bio-mimetic molecular catalyst or synthetic all-inorganic catalyst, in photocatalytic hybrid systems for water splitting and CO2 reduction. To highlight the advantages of semiconductors for engineering efficient and robust photocatalysts, we compare these systems to examples of homogeneous photocatalytic systems constructed from molecular photosensitisers (dyes). We conclude that all-inorganic catalysts coupled to appropriate semiconductors look more promising for the construction of robust photocatalytic hybrid systems for producing solar fuels."

Genetic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have demonstrated that ethylene inhibition of root growth involves another hormone signal, auxin. This study investigated why auxin was required by ethylene to regulate root growth. We initially observed that ethylene positively controls auxin biosynthesis in the root apex. We subsequently demonstrated that ethylene-regulated root growth is dependent on (1) the transport of auxin from the root apex via the lateral root cap and (2) auxin responses occurring in multiple elongation zone tissues. Detailed growth studies revealed that the ability of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid to inhibit root cell elongation was significantly enhanced in the presence of auxin. We conclude that by upregulating auxin biosynthesis, ethylene facilitates its ability to inhibit root cell expansion."

Two reactions that proceeded at different rates led to the formation of crosslinks between primary amine groups. The fastest reaction to occur was a nucleophilic attack on genipin by a primary amine group that led to the formation of a heterocyclic compound of genipin linked to the glucosamine residue in chitosan and the basic residues in BSA and gelatin. The second, slower, reaction was the nucleophilic substitution of the ester group possessed by genipin to form a secondary amide link with chitosan, BSA, or gelatin. A decreased crosslinking rate in the presence of deuterium oxide rather than water suggested that acid catalysis was necessary for one or both of the reactions to proceed. The behavior of the gel time with polymer concentration was consistent with second‐order gelation kinetics resulting from an irreversible crosslinking process, but was complicated by the oxygen radical‐induced polymerization of genipin that caused the gels to assume a blue color in the presence of air. The lower elastic modulus attained after a given time during crosslinking of the globular protein BSA as compared to the coiled protein gelatin, despite possessing more crosslinkable basic residues, demonstrated the importance of protein secondary and tertiary structures in determining the availability of sites for crosslinking with genipin in protein systems. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The selective hydrogenations of polyenes (such as 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene and 2,5-norbornadiene) are especially efficient. Good performance is found with these nanoparticle catalysts in the hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate to 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and of benzoic acid to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid or to cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid, and also in the conversion of benzene to cyclohexene (or cyclohexane), the latter being an increasingly important reaction in the context of the production of Nylon. Isolated atoms of noble metals (Pd, Rh, and Pt) in low oxidation states, appropriately complexed and tethered to the inner walls of nanoporous (ca. 3 nm diameter) silica, are very promising enantioselective hydrogenation catalysts. Nanoporous carbons, as well as other nanoporous oxides, may also be used to anchor and tether the kind of catalysts described here."

However, the development of HER electrocatalysts with Pt‐like or even superior activity, in particular ones that can function under alkaline conditions, remains a significant challenge. Here, the synthesis of a novel carbon‐loaded ruthenium nanoparticle electrocatalyst (Ru@CQDs) for the HER, using carbon quantum dots (CQDs), is reported. Electrochemical tests reveal that, even under extremely alkaline conditions (1 m KOH), the as‐formed Ru@CQDs exhibits excellent catalytic behavior with an onset overpotential of 0 mV, a Tafel slope of 47 mV decade −1 , and good durability. Most importantly, it only requires an overpotential of 10 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Such catalytic characteristics are superior to the current commercial Pt/C and most noble metals, non‐noble metals, and nonmetallic catalysts under basic conditions. These findings open a new field for the application of CQDs and add to the growing family of metal@CQDs with high HER performance."

Technologically, it is also important because it can facilitate the catalyst's design. However, to date, the understanding of this issue is rather limited. In this work, two types of reactions, CH(4) <--> CH(3) + H and CO <--> C + O on two transition metal surfaces, were chosen as model systems aiming to address in general where a catalytic reaction should occur. The dissociations of CH(4) --> CH(3) + H and CO --> C + O and their reverse reactions on flat, stepped, and kinked Rh and Pd surfaces were studied in detail. We find the following: First, for the CH(4) <--> Ch(3) + H reaction, the dissociation barrier is reduced by approximately 0.3 eV on steps and kinks as compared to that on flat surfaces. On the other hand, there is essentially no difference in barrier for the association reaction of CH(3) + H on the flat surfaces and the defects. Second, for the CO <--> C + O reaction, the dissociation barrier decreases dramatically (more than 0.8 eV on Rh and Pd) on steps and kinks as compared to that on flat surfaces. In contrast to the CH(3) + H reaction, the C + O association reaction also preferentially occurs on steps and kinks. We also present a detailed analysis of the reaction barriers in which each barrier is decomposed quantitatively into a local electronic effect and a geometrical effect. Our DFT calculations show that surface defects such as steps and kinks can largely facilitate bond breaking, while whether the surface defects could promote bond formation depends on the individual reaction as well as the particular metal. The physical origin of these trends is identified and discussed. On the basis of our results, we arrive at some simple rules with respect to where a reaction should occur: (i) defects such as steps are always favored for dissociation reactions as compared to flat surfaces; and (ii) the reaction site of the association reactions is largely related to the magnitude of the bonding competition effect, which is determined by the reactant and metal valency. Reactions with high valency reactants are more likely to occur on defects (more structure-sensitive), as compared to reactions with low valency reactants. Moreover, the reactions on late transition metals are more likely to proceed on defects than those on the early transition metals."

Thirteen novel ruthenium(II) organometallic arene complexes have been evaluated for activity (in vitro and in vivo) in models of human ovarian cancer, and cross-resistance profiles established in cisplatin and multi-drug-resistant variants. A broad range of IC50 values was obtained (0.5 to >100 μM) in A2780 parental cells with two compounds (RM175 and HC29) equipotent to carboplatin (6 μM), and the most active compound (HC11) equipotent to cisplatin (0.6 μM). Stable bi-dentate chelating ligands (ethylenediamine), a more hydrophobic arene ligand (tetrahydroanthracene) and a single ligand exchange centre (chloride) were associated with increased activity. None of the six active ruthenium(II) compounds were cross-resistant in the A2780cis cell line, demonstrated to be 10-fold resistant to cisplatin/carboplatin by a mechanism involving, at least in part, silencing of MLH1 protein expression via methylation. Varying degrees of cross-resistance were observed in the P-170 glycoprotein overexpressing multi-drug-resistant cell line 2780AD that could be reversed by co-treatment with verapamil. In vivo activity was established with RM175 in the A2780 xenograft together with non-cross-resistance in the A2780cis xenograft and a lack of activity in the 2780AD xenograft. High activity coupled to non cross-resistance in cisplatin resistant models merit further development of this novel group of anticancer compounds."

The inexpensive CQDs can be prepared by straightforward thermolysis of citric acid in a simple one-pot, multigram synthesis and are therefore scalable. The CQDs produced reducing equivalents under solar irradiation in a homogeneous photocatalytic system with a Ni-bis(diphosphine) catalyst, giving an activity of 398 μmolH2 (gCQD)(-1) h(-1) and a ""per Ni catalyst"" turnover frequency of 41 h(-1). The CQDs displayed activity in the visible region beyond λ > 455 nm and maintained their full photocatalytic activity for at least 1 day under full solar spectrum irradiation. A high quantum efficiency of 1.4% was recorded for the noble- and toxic-metal free photocatalytic system. Thus, CQDs are shown to be a highly sustainable light-absorbing material for photocatalytic schemes, which are not limited by cost, toxicity, or lack of scalability. The photocatalytic hybrid system was limited by the lifetime of the molecular catalyst, and intriguingly, no photocatalytic activity was observed using the CQDs and 3d transition metal salts or platinum precursors. This observation highlights the advantage of using a molecular catalyst over commonly used heterogeneous catalysts in this photocatalytic system."

Cultivation using a two-stage method was considered, whereby the cells were initially grown to a high concentration of biomass under nitrogen-sufficient conditions, before the supply of nitrogen was discontinued, whereupon the cells accumulated triacylglycerides. Cultivation in typical raceways and air-lift tubular bioreactors was investigated, as well as different methods of downstream processing. Results from this analysis showed that, if the future target for the productivity of lipids from microalgae, such as C. vulgaris, of ∼40 tons ha−1 year−1 could be achieved, cultivation in typical raceways would be significantly more environmentally sustainable than in closed air-lift tubular bioreactors. While biodiesel produced from microalgae cultivated in raceway ponds would have a GWP ∼ 80% lower than fossil-derived diesel (on the basis of the net energy content), if air-lift tubular bioreactors were used, the GWP of the biodiesel would be significantly greater than the energetically equivalent amount of fossil-derived diesel. The GWP and fossil-energy requirement in this operation were found to be particularly sensitive to (i) the yield of oil achieved during cultivation, (ii) the velocity of circulation of the algae in the cultivation facility, (iii) whether the culture media could be recycled or not, and (iv) the concentration of carbon dioxide in the flue gas. These results highlight the crucial importance of using life-cycle assessment to guide the future development of biodiesel from microalgae."

Clues that it is possible to interconvert sigma ligands without a change in oxidation state derive from C--H activation reactions effecting isotope exchange and from dynamic rearrangements of sigma complexes (see Frontispiece). Through these pathways, metathesis of M--E bonds can occur at late transition metals. We call this process sigma-complex-assisted metathesis, or sigma-CAM, which is distinct from the familiar sigma-bond metathesis (typical for d(0) metals and requiring no intermediate) and from oxidative-reductive elimination mechanisms (inherently requiring intermediates with changed oxidation states and sometimes involving sigma complexes). There are examples of sigma-CAM mechanisms in catalysis, especially for alkane borylation and isotope exchange of alkanes. It may also occur in silylation and alkene hydrogenation."

The cev1 mutant has constitutive expression of stress response genes and has enhanced resistance to fungal pathogens. Here, we show that cev1 plants have increased production of jasmonate and ethylene and that its phenotype is suppressed by mutations that interrupt jasmonate and ethylene signaling. Genetic mapping, complementation analysis, and sequence analysis revealed that CEV1 is the cellulose synthase CeSA3. CEV1 was expressed predominantly in root tissues, and cev1 roots contained less cellulose than wild-type roots. Significantly, the cev1 mutant phenotype could be reproduced by treating wild-type plants with cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors, and the cellulose synthase mutant rsw1 also had constitutive expression of VSP.

We consider such a system of interacting particles, propelled by persistent noises, and show that, at small but finite persistence time, their dynamics still satisfy a time-reversal symmetry. To do so, we compute perturbatively their steady-state measure and show that, for short persistent times, the entropy production rate vanishes. This endows such systems with an effective fluctuation-dissipation theorem akin to that of thermal equilibrium systems. Last, we show how interacting particle systems with viscous drags and correlated noises can be seen as in equilibrium with a viscoelastic bath but driven out of equilibrium by nonconservative forces, hence providing energetic insight into the departure of active systems from equilibrium.Received 18 April 2016DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.038103© 2016 American Physical SocietyPhysics Subject Headings (PhySH)Physical SystemsActive matterTechniquesTheories of collective dynamics & active matterPolymers & Soft Matter"

In addition, electrochemically relevant properties such as viscosity, conductivity, density, and melting point of RTILs are summarized from previous literature and are discussed. Karl Fisher titrations were carried out to determine the water content of RTILs for vacuum-dried, atmospheric, and wet samples. The anion in particular was found to affect the level of water uptake. The hydrophobicity of the anions adhered to the following trend: [FAP]− > [NTf2]− > [PF6]− > [BF4]− > halides. Cyclic voltammetry shows that an increase in water content significantly narrows the electrochemical window of each ionic liquid. The electrochemical window decreases in the following order: vacuum-dried > atmospheric > wet at 298 K > 318 K > 338 K. The anodic and cathodic potentials vs ferrocene internal reference are also listed under vacuum-dried and atmospheric conditions.

Using an intuitive picture of chemical reaction systems, each molecule is treated as a point-like particle that diffuses freely in three-dimensional space. When a pair of reactive molecules collide, such as an enzyme and its substrate, a reaction occurs and the simulated reactants are replaced by products. Achieving accurate bimolecular reaction kinetics is surprisingly difficult, requiring a careful consideration of reaction processes that are often overlooked. This includes whether the rate of a reaction is at steady-state and the probability that multiple reaction products collide with each other to yield a back reaction. Inputs to the simulation are experimental reaction rates, diffusion coefficients and the simulation time step. From these are calculated the simulation parameters, including the 'binding radius' and the 'unbinding radius', where the former defines the separation for a molecular collision and the latter is the initial separation between a pair of reaction products. Analytic solutions are presented for some simulation parameters while others are calculated using look-up tables. Capabilities of these methods are demonstrated with simulations of a simple bimolecular reaction and the Lotka–Volterra system."

In this paper, we show that the surface area calculated in a geometric fashion from the crystal structure is a useful tool for characterizing MOFs. We argue that the accessible surface area rather than the widely used Connolly surface area is the appropriate surface area to characterize crystalline solids for adsorption applications. The accessible surface area calculated with a probe diameter corresponding to the adsorbate of interest provides a simple way to screen and compare adsorbents. We investigate the effects of the probe molecule diameter on the accessible surface area and discuss the implications for increasing the surface area of metal−organic frameworks by the use of catenated structures. We also demonstrate that the accessible surface area provides a useful tool for judging the quality of a synthesized sample. Experimental surface areas can be adversely affected by incomplete solvent removal during activation, crystal collapse, or interpenetration. The easily calculated accessible surface area provides a benchmark for the theoretical upper limit for a perfect crystal."

For example, CO oxidation on Au/TiO(2) has been found to occur at a temperature as low as 200 K. Despite extensive studies in the field, the microscopic mechanism of CO oxidation on Au-based catalysts remains controversial. Aiming to provide insight into the catalytic roles of Au, we have performed extensive density functional theory calculations for the elementary steps in CO oxidation on Au surfaces. O atom adsorption, CO adsorption, O(2) dissociation, and CO oxidation on a series of Au surfaces, including flat surfaces, defects and small clusters, have been investigated in detail. Many transition states involved are located, and the lowest energy pathways are determined. We find the following: (i) the most stable site for O atom on Au is the bridge site of step edge, not a kink site; (ii) O(2) dissociation on Au (O(2)-->2O(ad)) is hindered by high barriers with the lowest barrier being 0.93 eV on a step edge; (iii) CO can react with atomic O with a substantially lower barrier, 0.25 eV, on Au steps where CO can adsorb; (iv) CO can react with molecular O(2) on Au steps with a low barrier of 0.46 eV, which features an unsymmetrical four-center intermediate state (O-O-CO); and (v) O(2) can adsorb on the interface of Au/TiO(2) with a reasonable chemisorption energy. On the basis of our calculations, we suggest that (i) O(2) dissociation on Au surfaces including particles cannot occur at low temperatures; (ii) CO oxidation on Au/inactive-materials occurs on Au steps via a two-step mechanism: CO+O(2)-->CO(2)+O, and CO+O-->CO(2); and (iii) CO oxidation on Au/active-materials also follows the two-step mechanism with reactions occurring at the interface."

Two parallel systems have been developed for overall water splitting under visible light involving graphitic carbon nitride with two different metal oxides, BiVO4 and WO3. Consequently, both hydrogen and oxygen can be evolved in an ideal ratio of 2:1, and evolution rates in both systems have been found to be dependent on pH, redox mediator concentration, and mass ratio between the two photocatalysts, leading to a stable and reproducible H2 and O2 evolution rate at 36 and 18 μmol h(-1) g(-1) from water over 14 h.

The toxicity of these ionic liquids was evaluated using filamentous fungi as model eukaryotic organisms. Surprisingly, most of the tested species showed active growth in media containing extremely high ionic liquid concentrations, up to molar ranges in some cases. The biodegradability of these ionic liquids was assessed, and new biotechnological applications for them are proposed, e.g. as solvents for biopolymers. This study leads to the better understanding of the anion influence on the ionic liquid toxicity, but its core is the recognition that conscious design of ionic liquids can be used to deliver truly biocompatible salts without adversely affecting one of the most striking of their properties—their outstanding solvent ability."

Here, we describe new strategies that markedly suppress such undesired pathways to result in diverse aromatic compounds previously not systematically targeted from lignin. Model studies established that a catalytic amount of triflic acid is very effective in cleaving the β-O-4 linkage, most abundant in lignin. An aldehyde product was identified as the main cause of side reactions under cleavage conditions. Capturing this unstable compound by reaction with diols and by in situ catalytic hydrogenation or decarbonylation lead to three distinct groups of aromatic compounds in high yields acetals, ethanol and ethyl aromatics, and methyl aromatics. Notably, the same product groups were obtained when these approaches were successfully extended to lignin. In addition, the formation of higher molecular weight side products was markedly suppressed, indicating that the aldehyde intermediates play a significant role in these processes. The described strategy has the potential to be generally applicable for the production of interesting aromatic compounds from lignin."

The singlet-triplet energy gap, a key factor for efficient utilization of triplets, is normally positive. Here we show that in a family of materials with amide donor and carbene acceptor moieties linked by a metal, this energy gap for singlet and triplet excitons with charge-transfer character can be tuned from positive to negative values via the rotation of donor and acceptor about the metal-amide bond. When the gap is close to zero, facile intersystem crossing is possible, enabling efficient emission from singlet excitons. We demonstrate solution-processed LEDs with exceptionally high quantum efficiencies (near-100% internal and >27% external quantum efficiencies), and current and power efficiencies (87 cd/A and 75 lm/W) comparable to, or exceeding, those of state-of-the-art vacuum-processed OLEDs and quantum dot LEDs."

As an important half-reaction involved, hydrogen evolution reaction is a complex electrochemical process involving liquid-solid-gas three-phase interface behaviour. Therefore, new concepts and strategies of material design are needed to smooth each pivotal step. Here we report a multiscale structural and electronic control of molybdenum disulfide foam to synergistically promote the hydrogen evolution process. The optimized three-dimensional molybdenum disulfide foam with uniform mesopores, vertically aligned two-dimensional layers and cobalt atoms doping demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution activity and stability. In addition, density functional theory calculations indicate that molybdenum disulfide with moderate cobalt doping content possesses the optimal activity. This study demonstrates the validity of multiscale control in molybdenum disulfide via overall consideration of the mass transport, and the accessibility, quantity and capability of active sites towards electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which may also be extended to other energy-related processes."

The phase has 47% permanently porous void volume and is shown to have >1 nm diameter pores with three-dimensional channels using probe molecule sorption. Enantioselective guest sorption is strongly dependent on guest size. The homochiral microporous phase was identified by reactive selection from a first-generation chiral but nonporous framework. Chiral permanent porosity is established by directional noncovalent interactions between framework-forming and nonframework forming components of the stable second-generation material, which become stronger upon loss of the guests from the pore system."

The harsh synthetic conditions and associated limited structural diversity do not benefit for further development and practical large-scale synthesis of CTFs. Herein we report a new strategy to construct CTFs (CTF-HUSTs) via a polycondensation approach, which allows the synthesis of CTFs under mild conditions from a wide array of building blocks. Interestingly, these CTFs display a layered structure. The CTFs synthesized were also readily scaled up to gram quantities. The CTFs are potential candidates for separations, photocatalysis and for energy storage applications. In particular, CTF-HUSTs are found to be promising photocatalysts for sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with a maximum rate of 2647 μmol h-1 g-1 under visible light. We also applied a pyrolyzed form of CTF-HUST-4 as an anode material in a sodium-ion battery achieving an excellent discharge capacity of 467 mAh g-1 ."

It is easily formed by the oxidation of organic molecules, during combustion or respiration, but is difficult to reduce. The production of reduced carbon compounds from CO(2) is an attractive proposition, because carbon-neutral energy sources could be used to generate fuel resources and sequester CO(2) from the atmosphere. However, available methods for the electrochemical reduction of CO(2) require excessive overpotentials (are energetically wasteful) and produce mixtures of products. Here, we show that a tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase enzyme (FDH1) adsorbed to an electrode surface catalyzes the efficient electrochemical reduction of CO(2) to formate. Electrocatalysis by FDH1 is thermodynamically reversible--only small overpotentials are required, and the point of zero net catalytic current defines the reduction potential. It occurs under thoroughly mild conditions, and formate is the only product. Both as a homogeneous catalyst and on the electrode, FDH1 catalyzes CO(2) reduction with a rate more than two orders of magnitude faster than that of any known catalyst for the same reaction. Formate oxidation is more than five times faster than CO(2) reduction. Thermodynamically, formate and hydrogen are oxidized at similar potentials, so formate is a viable energy source in its own right as well as an industrially important feedstock and a stable intermediate in the conversion of CO(2) to methanol and methane. FDH1 demonstrates the feasibility of interconverting CO(2) and formate electrochemically, and it is a template for the development of robust synthetic catalysts suitable for practical applications."

Titania based solid-state hybrid solar cells are moderately efficient at converting visible photons to electrons, but major electrical losses still remain. A material based paradigm shift is required to dramatically enhance the performance of these devices. Here, we present an investigation into solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSCs) incorporating a molecular hole-transporter and mesoporous tin oxide electrodes, in place of titania usually employed. We investigate the influence of treating the surface of the SnO2 with different oxides and find that MgO ""passivated"" SnO2 electrodes demonstrate an unprecedented absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of near unity across a broad spectral range. A dual surface treatment of TiO2 followed by MgO enables tuning of the solar cell photovoltage, fill factor, and efficiency with visible light absorbing cells delivering 3% solar-to-electrical full sun power conversion efficiency."

Through biomineralization, organisms can harness and control this process to form various functional materials that can act as anything from shells through to lenses. The early stages of calcium carbonate formation have recently attracted attention as stable prenucleation clusters have been observed, contrary to classical models. Here we show, using computer simulations combined with the analysis of experimental data, that these mineral clusters are made of an ionic polymer, composed of alternating calcium and carbonate ions, with a dynamic topology consisting of chains, branches and rings. The existence of a disordered, flexible and strongly hydrated precursor provides a basis for explaining the formation of other liquid-like amorphous states of calcium carbonate, in addition to the non-classical behaviour during growth of amorphous calcium carbonate. Prenucleation clusters have been observed during the early stages of calcium carbonate formation, contrary to classical models. Here, computer simulations indicate that the clusters are composed of an ionic polymer with alternating calcium and carbonate ions, and a dynamic topology of chains, branches and rings."

Herein, a hetero-single-atom (h-SA) ORR electrocatalyst is presented, which has atomically dispersed Fe and Ni coanchored to a microsized nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon support with unique trimodal-porous structure configured by highly ordered macropores interconnected through mesopores. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra confirm that Fe- and Ni-SAs are affixed to the carbon support via FeN4 and NiN4 coordination bonds. The resultant Fe/Ni h-SA electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity, outperforming SA electrocatalysts with only Fe- or Ni-SAs, and the benchmark Pt/C. The obtained experimental results indicate that the achieved outstanding ORR performance results from the synergetic enhancement induced by the coexisting FeN4 and NiN4 sites, and the superior mass-transfer capability promoted by the trimodal-porous-structured carbon support."

The anatase versus rutile relative phase stability at 0 K and zero pressure has been investigated using high-quality basis sets and carefully controlled computational parameters. From the optimal crystal structures obtained with the Hartree-Fock theory at various pressures, the bulk modulus and phase transition pressures of various high-pressure polymorphs have been derived at the athermal limit. In most cases, the calculated unit cell data agree to within 2% of the corresponding experimental determination. Complete predicted structural data (unit cell constants and fractional atomic coordinates) are presented for the baddeleyite and pyrite forms. The calculated bulk moduli are within 10% of the most reliable experimental results. Both the all-electron LCAO and pseudopotential PW methods predict anatase to be more stable than rutile at 0 K and ambient pressure. The computed anatase-columbite, rutile-columbite, columbite-baddeleyite, and baddeleyite-cotunnite phase transitions appear in the same order as observed in experiments, and the transition pressures agree semiquantitatively with those measured. The pyrite and fluorite structures are predicted to be less stable than other polymorphs at pressures below 70 GPa in agreement with experiments.

Ni-based DRM catalysts are promising due to their high activity and low cost, but suffer from poor stability due to coke formation which has hindered their commercialization. Herein, we report that atomically dispersed Ni single atoms, stabilized by interaction with Ce-doped hydroxyapatite, are highly active and coke-resistant catalytic sites for DRM. Experimental and computational studies reveal that isolated Ni atoms are intrinsically coke-resistant due to their unique ability to only activate the first C-H bond in CH 4 , thus avoiding methane deep decomposition into carbon. This discovery offers new opportunities to develop large-scale DRM processes using earth abundant catalysts."

The internalization of the particles in cell lines expressing different levels of folate receptors was studied. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the mean number of nanoparticles internalized per cell. Five times more particles were internalized by cancer cells expressing folate receptors as compared to the normal cells expressing low levels of the receptor. Not only the number of nanoparticles internalized per cell, but also the fraction of cells that had internalized nanoparticles was higher. The total number of particles internalized by the cancer cells was, therefore, about an order of magnitude higher than the total number of particles internalized by normal cells, a difference high enough to be of significant biological importance.

Here, we report a scalable method to create arrays of single-photon emitting QEs in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulphide (WS2) using a nanopatterned silica substrate. We obtain devices with QE numbers in the range of hundreds, limited only by the flake size, and a QE yield approaching unity. The overall quality of these deterministic QEs surpasses that of their randomly appearing counterparts, with spectral wanderings of around 0.1 meV, an order of magnitude lower than previous reports.

This is ascribed to the ferroelectricity of the tetragonal phase. The influence of ferroelectricity ensures a tightly bound layer of dye molecule and also acts to separate the photoexcited carriers due to the internal space charge layer.

Reaction of KHB(sec)Bu(3) with 1 yields trans-Ru(H)(2)(R-binap)(tmen) (5) while reaction of KHB(sec)Bu(3) or KO(t)Bu with 2 under Ar yields the new hydridoamido complex RuH(PPh(3))(2)(NH(2)CMe(2)CMe(2)NH) (4). Complex 4 has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the amido nitrogen in the equatorial plane. Loss of H(2) from 5 results in the related complex RuH(R-binap)(NH(2)CMe(2)CMe(2)NH) (3). Reaction of H(2) with 4 yields the trans-dihydride (OC-6-22)-Ru(H)(2)(PPh(3))(2)(tmen)(6). Calculations support the assignment of the structures. The hydrogenation of acetophenone is catalyzed by 5 or 4 in benzene or 2-propanol without the need for added base. For 5 in benzene at 293 K over the ranges of concentrations [5] = 10(-)(4) to 10(-)(3) M, [ketone] = 0.1 to 0.5 M, and of pressures of H(2) = 8 to 23 atm, the rate law is rate = k[5][H(2)] with k = 3.3 M(-1) s(1), DeltaH++ = 8.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -28 +/- 2 cal mol(-1) K(-1). For 4 in benzene at 293 K over the ranges of concentrations [4] = 10(-4) to 10(-3) M, [ketone] 0.1 to 0.7 M, and of pressures of H(2) = 1 to 6 atm, the preliminary rate law is rate = k[4][H(2)] with k = 1.1 x 10(2) M(-1) s(-1), DeltaH++ = 7.6 +/- 0.3 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23 +/- 1 cal mol(-1) K(-1). Both theory and experiment suggest that the intramolecular heterolytic splitting of dihydrogen across the polar Ru=N bond of the amido complexes 3 and 4 is the turn-over limiting step. A transition state structure and reaction energy profile is calculated. The transfer of H(delta+)/H(delta-) to the ketone from the RuH and NH groups of 5 in a Noyori metal-ligand bifunctional mechanism is a fast process and it sets the chirality as (R)-1-phenylethanol (62-68% ee) in the hydrogenation of acetophenone. The rate of hydrogenation of acetophenone catalyzed by 5 is slower and the ee of the product is low (14% S) when 2-propanol is used as the solvent, but both the rate and ee (up to 55% R) increase when excess KO(t)Bu is added. The formation of ruthenium alkoxide complexes in 2-propanol might explain these observations. Alkoxide complexes [RuP(2)]H(OR)(tmen), [RuP(2)] = Ru(R-binap) or Ru(PPh(3))(2), R= (i) Pr, CHPhMe, (t)Bu, are observed by reacting the alcohols (i)PrOH, phenylethanol, and (t)BuOH with the dihydrides 5 and 6, respectively, under Ar. In the absence of H(2), the amido complexes 3 and 4 react with acetophenone to give the ketone adducts [RuP(2)]H(O=CPhMe)(NH(2)CMe(2)CMe(2)NH) in equilibrium with the enolate complexes trans- [RuP(2)](H)(OCPh=CH(2))(tmen) and eventually the decomposition products [RuP(2)]H(eta(5)-CH(2)CPhCHCPhO), with the binap complex characterized crystallographically. In general, proton transfer from the weakly acidic molecules dihydrogen, alcohol, or acetophenone to the amido nitrogen of complexes 3 and 4 is favored in two ways when the molecule coordinates to ruthenium: (1) an increase in acidity of the molecule by the Lewis acidic metal and (2) an increase in the basicity of the amido nitrogen caused by its pyramidalization. The formato complexes trans-[RuP(2)]H(OCHO)(tmen) were prepared by reacting the respective complex 4 or 5 with formic acid. The crystal structure of RuH(OCHO)(PPh(3))(2)(tmen) displays similar features to the calculated transition state for H(delta+)/H(delta-) transfer to the ketone in the catalytic cycle."

For a given functional (except LSDA) Stuttgart-type quasi-relativistic effective core potentials and an all-electron scalar relativistic approach (ZORA) tend to produce very similar geometries. In contrast to the lighter congeners, LSDA affords reasonably accurate geometries of 5d-metal complexes, as it is among the functionals with the lowest mean and standard deviations from experiment. For this set the ranking of some other popular density functionals, ordered according to decreasing standard deviation, is BLYP > VSXC > BP86 ≈ BPW91 ≈ TPSS ≈ B3LYP ≈ PBE > TPSSh > B3PW91 ≈ B3P86 ≈ PBE hybrid. In this case hybrid functionals are superior to their nonhybrid variants. In addition, we have reinvestigated the previous test sets for 3d- (Bühl M.; Kabrede, H. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2006, 2, 1282-1290) and 4d- (Waller, M. P.; Bühl, M. J. Comput.

For this combined test set comprising first-, second-, and third-row metal complexes, B3P86 and PBE hybrid are indicated to perform best. A remarkably consistent standard deviation of around 2 pm in metal-ligand bond distances is achieved over the entire set of d-block elements."

The oxidation in a batch reactor at 60 °C and 1 bar pressure using air as oxidant was initially investigated. Under these conditions, supported Pd and Pt catalysts give some selectivity to glyceric acid, but the main reaction products are considered to be non-desired C1 by-products, e.g. CO2, HCHO and HCOOH. In addition, under these conditions, supported Au catalysts were totally inactive. Using an autoclave with pure oxygen at 3 bar pressure gave a significant improvement in reactivity and, for Pt and Au catalysts, the formation of C1 by-products was eliminated when NaOH was added. In particular, it was noted that, in the absence of NaOH, the Au/C catalyst was inactive. For 1 wt.% Au/graphite or activated carbon, 100% selectivity to glyceric acid at high conversion was readily achieved. The role of the base is discussed and it is proposed that the base aids the initial dehydrogenation via H-abstraction of one of the primary OH groups of glycerol and, in this way, the rate limiting step in the oxidation process is overcome."

It is widely accepted that Li+ may be extracted (deintercalated) from such lithium manganese oxides accompanied by oxidation of Mn up to a maximum oxidation state of +4. However, it has been suggested recently that further Li+ removal may be possible. Among the mechanisms that have been proposed to charge balance the removal of Li+ are Mn oxidation beyond +4 or loss of O2-. To investigate this phenomenon we have selected Li2MnO3, a layered compound Li[Li1/3Mn2/3]O2 with a ready supply of mobile Li+ ions but with all Mn already in the +4 oxidation state. We show that a substantial quantity of Li (at least 1.39 Li) may be removed. At 55 °C this occurs exclusively by oxidation of the nonaqueous electrolyte, thus generating H+ which exchange one-for-one with Li+ to form Li2-xHxMnO3. The presence of H+ between the oxide layers results in a change of the layer stacking from O3 to P3, the latter being more stable for O−H−O bonding. At 30 °C initial Li removal is accompanied by oxygen loss (effective removal of Li2O) but further Li+ removal involves the same proton exchange mechanism as observed at 55 °C. The reaction is partially reversible. On extended cycling the material converts to spinel."

Herein, we report that the local electronic structure of Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) could be favorably modulated through strong interfacial interactions with FeOOH nanoparticles (NPs). The biphasic and multiscale composites FeOOH/LDH demonstrated an increasingly pronounced synergy effect for OER catalysis when the average size of FeOOH NPs decreases from 18.0 to 2.0 nm. Particularly, the composite with average size of FeOOH NPs of 2.0 nm exhibited an overpotential of 174 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a tafel slope of 27 mV dec–1 in 1.0 M KOH, outmatching all the noble and non-noble OER catalysts reported so far; it also operates smoothly in various stability tests. A mechanistic study based on XANES and EXAFS analysis, d.c. voltammetry and large amplitude Fourier Transformed a.c. voltammetry proved the presence of high-oxidation-state Fe(3+δ)+sites with relatively short Fe(3+δ)+–O bond from the highly unsaturated ultrafine FeOOH NPs which could reform the local electronic structure and favorably manipulate the electronic oxidation and thus electrocatalytic behaviors of the Ni2+ species in the Ni–Fe LDH, hence leading to the easy formation, excellent OER activity, and extraordinary structural and catalytic stability. Our work puts an emphasis on the role of the solid–solid interfacial chemistry between a Ni–Fe LDH and a non-noble-metal component in engineering the local electronic structure of the active metal sites, which successfully pushed forward the catalytic activity of the well-studied Ni–Fe LDH far beyond its current limit in OER catalysis and opened up an avenue for rational design of OER electrocatalysts."

We present a series of self-assembled nickel terpyridine complexes as electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO in organic media. Immobilization on CdS quantum dots allows these catalysts to be active in purely aqueous solution and photocatalytically reduce CO2 with >90% selectivity under UV-filtered simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm–2, λ > 400 nm, pH 6.7, 25 °C).

Tosylate (Tos(-)) counterions favored ST and bromide (Br(-)) RB morphologies at ultralow SOA concentrations. Both anions yielded a worm-like (WO) morphology at high SOA concentrations. A three-step formation mechanism based on self-assembly and ion competition at the electrical palisade of micelles is proposed. Facile recovery and redispersion using specific SOAs allowed a high yield production at the kilogram scale. This novel technique has practical applications in industry."

These QDs are exploited as a sensitizer in solid‐state solar cells with 2,2′,7,7′‐tetrakis( N , N ‐di‐ p ‐methoxyphenylamine)‐9,9′‐spirobifluorene (spiro‐OMeTAD) as a hole conductor. High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that PbS QDs of around 3 nm in size are distributed homogeneously over the TiO 2 surface and are well separated from each other if prepared under common SILAR deposition conditions. The pore size of the TiO 2 films and the deposition medium are found to be very critical in determining the overall performance of the solid‐state QD cells. By incorporating promising inorganic QDs (PbS) and an organic hole conductor spiro‐OMeTAD into the solid‐state cells, it is possible to attain an efficiency of over 1% for PbS‐sensitized solid‐state cells after some optimizations. The optimized deposition cycle of the SILAR process for PbS QDs has also been confirmed by transient spectroscopic studies on the hole generation of spiro‐OMeTAD. In addition, it is established that the PbS QD layer plays a role in mediating the interfacial recombination between the spiro‐OMeTAD + cation and the TiO 2 conduction band electron, and that the lifetime of these species can change by around 2 orders of magnitude by varying the number of SILAR cycles used. When a near infrared (NIR)‐absorbing zinc carboxyphthalocyanine dye (TT1) is added on top of the PbS‐sensitized electrode to obtain a panchromatic response, two signals from each component are observed, which results in an improved efficiency. In particular, when a CdS‐sensitized electrode is first prepared, and then co‐sensitized with a squarine dye (SQ1), the resulting color change is clearly an addition of each component and the overall efficiencies are also added in a more synergistic way than those in PbS/TT1‐modified cells because of favorable charge‐transfer energetics."

Solar hydrogen generation through the photolytic splitting of water sensitised by semiconductor materials is attractive as it is both renewable and does not lead to problematic by-products, unlike current hydrogen sources such as natural gas. Consequently, the development of these semiconductor materials has undergone considerable research since their discovery over 30 years ago and it would seem prescient to review the more practical results of this research. Among the critical factors influencing the choice of semiconductor material for photoelectrolysis of water are the band-gap energies, flat band potentials and stability towards photocorrosion; the latter of these points directs us to focus on metal oxides. Careful design of thin films of photocatalyst material can eliminate potential routes of losses in performance, i.e., recombination at grain boundaries. Methods to overcome these problems are discussed such as coupling a photoanode for photolysis of water to a photovoltaic cell in a “tandem cell” device."

Moreover, the content of Cu2O in the composite hollow microspheres increased with increasing the reaction time or/and precursor concentration to produce a range of composite hollow microspheres with Cu2O contents from 20 to 80 wt %.

Herein we report that magnesium oxides (MgO) in CuOMgO/Fe3O4 not only enhanced the catalytic properties but also switched the free radical peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-activated process into the 1O2 based nonradical process. CuOMgO/Fe3O4 catalyst exhibited consistent performance in a wide pH range from 5.0 to 10.0, and the degradation kinetics were not inhibited by the common free radical scavengers, anions, or natural organic matter. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) revealed the relationship between the degradation rate constant of 14 substituted phenols and their conventional descriptor variables (i.e., Hammett constants σ, σ-, σ+), half-wave oxidation potential (E1/2), and pKa values. QSARs together with the kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) recognized the electron transfer as the dominant oxidation process. Characterizations and DFT calculation indicated that the incorporated MgO alters the copper sites to highly oxidized metal centers, offering a more suitable platform for PMS to generate metastable copper intermediates. These highly oxidized metals centers of copper played the key role in producing O2•- after accepting an electron from another PMS molecule, and finally 1O2 as sole reactive species was generated from the direct oxidation of O2•- through thermodynamically feasible reactions."

For the proper design of carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts for the ORR, it would be interesting to identify the active sites of the electrocatalyst. The ORR was now studied with an air-saturated electrolyte solution droplet (diameter ca. 15 μm), which was deposited at a specified position either on the edge or on the basal plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Electrochemical measurements suggest that the edge carbon atoms are more active than the basal-plane ones for the ORR. This provides a direct way to identify the active sites of carbon materials for the ORR. Ball-milled graphite and carbon nanotubes with more exposed edges were also prepared and showed significantly enhanced ORR activity. DFT calculations elucidated the mechanism by which the charged edge carbon atoms result in the higher ORR activity."

Arsenic species retain original oxidation states and occupy similar environments on the oxyhydroxide substrates, with first-shell coordination to four oxygens at 1.78 Å for As(III) and 1.69 Å for As(V). In agreement with other workers, we find that inner sphere complexes form, apparently involving bidentate (bridging) arsenate or arsenite. Interaction of As(III) and As(V) with the sulfide surfaces shows primary coordination to four oxygens (As−O: 1.69−1.76 Å) with further sulfur (∼3.1 Å) and iron (3.4−3.5 Å) shells suggesting outer sphere complexation. Arsenic species were also coprecipitated with mackinawite (pH 4.0), and these samples were further studied following oxidation. At high As(III) or As(V) concentrations, arsenate or arsenite species form, probably as sorption complexes, along with poorly crystalline arsenic sulfide (the only product at low As(V) concentrations). All oxidized samples show primary coordination to four oxygens at 1.7 Å, indicating As(V); these arsenates may show both outer sphere complexation with residual mackinawite and inner sphere complexation with new oxyhydroxides. These experiments help to clarify our understanding of As mobility in near-surface environments."

A series of potent inhibitors has been designed by computer modeling, which exploit the unique structural features of quadruplex DNA. These 3,6,9-trisubstituted acridine inhibitors are predicted to interact selectively with the human DNA quadruplex structure, as a means of specifically inhibiting the action of human telomerase in extending the length of single-stranded telomeric DNA. The anilino substituent at the 9-position of the acridine chromophore is predicted to lie in a third groove of the quadruplex. Calculated relative binding energies predict enhanced selectivity compared with earlier 3,6-disubstituted compounds, as a result of this substituent. The ranking order of energies is in accord with equilibrium binding constants for quadruplex measured by surface plasmon resonance techniques, which also show reduced duplex binding compared with the disubstituted compounds. The 3,6,9-trisubstututed acridines have potent in vitro inhibitory activity against human telomerase, with EC 50 values of up to 60 nM."

However, little is known about the fundamental photophysical processes of g-C3N4, which are key to explain and promote photoactivity. Using time-resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies, we have investigated the photophysics of a series of carbon nitrides on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to seconds. Free charge carriers form within a 200 fs excitation pulse, trap on the picosecond time scale with trap states in a range of energies, and then recombine with power law decays that are indicative of charge trapping–detrapping processes. Delayed photoluminescence is assigned to thermal excitation of trapped carriers back up to the conduction/valence bands. We develop a simple, quantitative model for the charge carrier dynamics in these photocatalysts, which includes carrier relaxation into an exponential tail of trap states extending up to 1.5 eV into the bandgap. This trapping reduces the efficiency of surface photocatalytic reactions. Deep trapped electrons observed on micro- to millisecond time scales are unable to reduce electron acceptors on the surface or in solution. Within a series of g-C3N4, the yield of these unreactive trapped electrons correlates inversely with H2 evolution rates. We conclude by arguing that the photophysics of these carbon nitride materials show closer parallels with inorganic semiconductors than conjugated polymers, and that the key challenge to optimize photocatalytic activity of these materials is to prevent electron trapping into deep, and photocatalytically inactive, electron trap states."

However, recent experimental studies of laboratory-synthesized and alkali-activated slag (AAS) binders have indicated that the calcium-sodium aluminosilicate hydrate [C-(N)-A-S-H] gel formed in these systems can be significantly cross-linked. Here, we propose a model that describes the C-(N)-A-S-H gel as a mixture of cross-linked and non-cross-linked tobermorite-based structures (the cross-linked substituted tobermorite model, CSTM), which can more appropriately describe the spectroscopic and density information available for this material. Analysis of the phase assemblage and Al coordination environments of AAS binders shows that it is not possible to fully account for the chemistry of AAS by use of the assumption that all of the tetrahedral Al is present in a tobermorite-type C-(N)-A-S-H gel, due to the structural constraints of the gel. Application of the CSTM can for the first time reconcile this information, indicating the presence of an additional activation product that contains highly connected four-coordinated silicate and aluminate species. The CSTM therefore provides a more advanced description of the chemistry and structure of calcium-sodium aluminosilicate gel structures than that previously established in the literature."

Avibactam is a structural class of inhibitor that does not contain a β-lactam core but maintains the capacity to covalently acylate its β-lactamase targets. Using the TEM-1 enzyme, we characterized avibactam inhibition by measuring the on-rate for acylation and the off-rate for deacylation. The deacylation off-rate was 0.045 min −1 , which allowed investigation of the deacylation route from TEM-1. Using NMR and MS, we showed that deacylation proceeds through regeneration of intact avibactam and not hydrolysis. Other than TEM-1, four additional clinically relevant β-lactamases were shown to release intact avibactam after being acylated. We showed that avibactam is a covalent, slowly reversible inhibitor, which is a unique mechanism of inhibition among β-lactamase inhibitors."

A straightforward synthesis route was employed, offering the potential for large scale preparation of this material. Inverted OPV devices employing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor polymer and FBR as the acceptor gave power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 4.1%. Transient and steady state optical spectroscopies indicated efficient, ultrafast charge generation and efficient photocurrent generation from both donor and acceptor. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate polaron generation efficiency as well as recombination dynamics. It was determined that the P3HT:FBR blend is highly intermixed, leading to increased charge generation relative to comparative devices with P3HT:PC60BM, but also faster recombination due to a nonideal morphology in which, in contrast to P3HT:PC60BM devices, the acceptor does not aggregate enough to create appropriate percolation pathways that prevent fast nongeminate recombination. Despite this nonoptimal morphology the P3HT:FBR devices exhibit better performance than P3HT:PC60BM devices, used as control, demonstrating that this acceptor shows great promise for further optimization."

The hypothesis 'leaves minimise the summed unit costs of transpiration and carboxylation' predicts leaf-internal/ambient CO2 ratios (ci/ca) and slopes of maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) or leaf nitrogen (Narea) vs. stomatal conductance. Analysis of data on woody species from contrasting climates (cold-hot, dry-wet) yielded steeper slopes and lower mean ci/ca ratios at the dry or cold sites than at the wet or hot sites. High atmospheric vapour pressure deficit implies low ci/ca in dry climates. High water viscosity (more costly transport) and low photorespiration (less costly photosynthesis) imply low ci/ca in cold climates. Observed site-mean ci/ca shifts are predicted quantitatively for temperature contrasts (by photorespiration plus viscosity effects) and approximately for aridity contrasts. The theory explains the dependency of ci/ca ratios on temperature and vapour pressure deficit, and observed relationships of leaf δ13C and Narea to aridity."

Their function is based on photoinduced charge separation at a dye-sensitized interface between a nanocrystalline, mesoporous metal oxide electrode and a redox electrolyte. They have been the subject of substantial academic and commercial research over the last 20 years, motivated by their potential as a low-cost solar energy conversion technology. Substantial progress has been made in enhancing the efficiency, stability, and processability of this technology and, in particular, the interplay between these technology drivers. However, despite intense research efforts, our ability to identify predictive materials and structure/device function relationships and, thus, achieve the rational optimization of materials and device design, remains relatively limited. A key challenge in developing such predictive design tools is the chemical complexity of the device. DSSCs comprise distinct materials components, including metal oxide nanoparticles, a molecular sensitizer dye, and a redox electrolyte, all of which exhibit complex interactions with each other. In particular, the electrolyte alone is chemically complex, including not only a redox couple (almost always iodide/iodine) but also a range of additional additives found empirically to enhance device performance. These molecular solutes make up typically 20% of the electrolyte by volume. As with most molecular systems, they exhibit complex interactions with both themselves and the other device components (e.g., the sensitizer dye and the metal oxide). Moreover, these interactions can be modulated by solar irradiation and device operation. As such, understanding the function of these photoelectrochemical solar cells requires careful consideration of the chemical complexity and its impact upon device operation. In this Account, we focus on the process by which electrons injected into the nanocrystalline electrode are collected by the external electrical circuit in real devices under operating conditions. We first of all summarize device function, including the energetics and kinetics of the key processes, using an ""idealized"" description, which does not fully account for much of the chemical complexity of the system. We then go on to consider recent advances in our understanding of the impact of these complexities upon the efficiency of electron collection. These include ""catalysis"" of interfacial recombination losses by surface adsorption processes and the influence of device operating conditions upon the recombination rate constant and conduction band energy, both attributed to changes in the chemical composition of the interface. We go on to discuss appropriate methodologies for quantifying the efficiency of electron collection in devices under operation. Finally, we show that, by taking into account these advances in our understanding of the DSSC function, we are able to recreate the current/voltage curves of both efficient and degraded devices without any fitting parameters and, thus, gain significant insight into the determinants of DSSC performance."

Examination of charge densities, natural bond orbitals (NBO), and delocalised molecular orbitals computed at the B3LYP and MP2/6-31(++)G(d,p) levels have enabled us to explain a number of experimental phenomena: the relative acidity of different sites on the imidazolium ring, variations in hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor abilities, the apparent contradiction of the hydrogen-bond-donor parameters for different types of solute, the low probability of finding a Cl(-) anion at the rear of the imidazolium ring and the expansion of the imidazolium ring in the presence of a strong hydrogen-bond acceptor. The unreactive but coordinating environment and large electrochemical window have also been accounted for, as has the strong electron-donating character of the carbon atoms to the rear of the ring in associated imidazolylidenes. The electronic structure of the [C(4)C(1)im](+) cation is best described by a C(4)==C(5) double bond at the rear, and a delocalised three-centre 4 e(-) component across the front (N(1)-C(2)-N(3)) of the imidazolium ring; delocalisation between these regions is also significant. Hydrogen-bond formation is driven by Coulombic stabilisation, which compensates for an associated destabilisation of the electronic part of the system. Interactions are dominated by a large positive charge at C(2) and the build up of pi-electron density above and below the ring, particularly that associated with the double bond between C(4) and C(5). The NBO partial charges have been computed and compared with those used in a number of classical simulations."

A solid fraction enriched in cellulose was recovered, which was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Up to 90% of the glucose and 25% of the hemicellulose contained in the original biomass were released by the combined ionic liquid pretreatment and the enzymatic hydrolysis. After the pretreatment, the ionic liquid liquor contained the majority of the lignin and the hemicellulose. The lignin portion was partially precipitated from the liquor upon dilution with water. The amount of hemicellulose monomers in the ionic liquid liquor and their conversion into furfurals was also examined. The performance of ionic liquid–water mixtures containing 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids with acetate, methanesulfonate, trifluoromethanesulfonate and chloride anions was investigated.

Despite many Minisci-type protocols that result in the formation of stereocenters, exerting control over the absolute stereochemistry at these centers remains an unmet challenge. We report a process for addition of prochiral radicals, generated from amino acid derivatives, to pyridines and quinolines. Our method offers excellent control of both enantioselectivity and regioselectivity. An enantiopure chiral Brønsted acid catalyst serves both to activate the substrate and induce asymmetry, while an iridium photocatalyst mediates the required electron transfer processes.

The synthesis methodology comprises two steps: (i) hydrothermal carbonization of organic materials and (ii) chemical activation with KOH as activating agent. In this way, activated carbon materials with a high surface area (up to 2700 m2 g−1) and narrow micropore size distribution in the supermicropore range (0.7–2 nm) are produced. The textural properties of the activated carbon products can be easily tuned by modifying the activating conditions (i.e., the activation temperature and the amount of KOH used). The activated carbon materials exhibit high hydrogen uptakes, up to 6.4 wt%, and large isosteric heats of adsorption, up to 8.5 kJ mol−1. In particular, the hydrogen storage density of the carbons is high and ranges between 12 and 16.4 µmol H2 m−2. The hydrogen storage density is closely related to the pore size of the carbons, with small micropores (ca. 1 nm) favouring a high density. Taking into account the high hydrogen storage capacities of these materials, as well as the simplicity of their synthesis procedure and the ready availability and low-cost of the raw precursors, it can be concluded that these activated carbons constitute a promising adsorbent for hydrogen storage."

The simplest reactions of perfluoroarenes result in C-F oxida tive addition, but C-H activation competes with C-F activation for partially fluorinated molecules. We first consider the reactivity of the fluoroaromatics toward nickel and platinum complexes, but extend to rhenium and rhodium where they give special insight. Sections on spectroscopy and molecular structure are followed by discussions of energetics and mechanism that incorporate experimental and computational results. We highlight special characteristics of the metal-fluorine bond and the influence of the fluorine substituents on energetics and mechanism. Fluoroaromatics reacting at an ML(2) center initially yield η(2)-arene complexes, followed usually by oxidative addition to generate MF(Ar(F))(L)(2) or MH(Ar(F))(L)(2) (M is Ni, Pd, or Pt; L is trialkylphosphine). The outcome of competition between C-F and C-H bond activation is strongly metal dependent and regioselective. When C-H bonds of fluoroaromatics are activated, there is a preference for the remaining C-F bonds to lie ortho to the metal. An unusual feature of metal-fluorine bonds is their response to replacement of nickel by platinum. The Pt-F bonds are weaker than their nickel counterparts; the opposite is true for M-H bonds. Metal-fluorine bonds are sufficiently polar to form M-F···H-X hydrogen bonds and M-F···I-C(6)F(5) halogen bonds. In the competition between C-F and C-H activation, the thermodynamic product is always the metal fluoride, but marked differences emerge between metals in the energetics of C-H activation. In metal-fluoroaryl bonds, ortho-fluorine substituents generally control regioselectivity and make C-H activation more energetically favorable. The role of fluorine substituents in directing C-H activation is traced to their effect on bond energies. Correlations between M-C and H-C bond energies demonstrate that M-C bond energies increase far more on ortho-fluorine substitution than do H-C bonds. Conventional oxidative addition reactions involve a three-center triangular transition state between the carbon, metal, and X, where X is hydrogen or fluorine, but M(d)-F(2p) repulsion raises the activation energies when X is fluorine. Platinum complexes exhibit an alternative set of reactions involving rearrangement of the phosphine and the fluoroaromatics to a metal(alkyl)(fluorophosphine), M(R)(Ar(F))(PR(3))(PR(2)F). In these phosphine-assisted C-F activation reactions, the phosphine is no spectator but rather is intimately involved as a fluorine acceptor. Addition of the C-F bond across the M-PR(3) bond leads to a metallophosphorane four-center transition state; subsequent transfer of the R group to the metal generates the fluorophosphine product. We find evidence that a phosphine-assisted pathway may even be significant in some apparently simple oxidative addition reactions. While transition metal catalysis has revolutionized hydrocarbon chemistry, its impact on fluorocarbon chemistry has been more limited. Recent developments have changed the outlook as catalytic reactions involving C-F or C-H bond activation of fluorocarbons have emerged. The principles established here have several implications for catalysis, including the regioselectivity of C-H activation and the unfavorable energetics of C-F reductive elimination. Palladium-catalyzed C-H arylation is analyzed to illustrate how ortho-fluorine substituents influence thermodynamics, kinetics, and regioselectivity."

In this perspective we present an overview of our recent studies of the dynamics of photoinduced charge carrier processes in hematite, derived primarily from transient absorption spectroscopy of nanostructured photoanodes.

J. Med. Chem. 2001). We have determined the structures of monofunctional adducts of the ""piano-stool"" complexes [(η6-Bip)Ru(II)(en)Cl][PF6] (1, Bip = biphenyl), [(η6-THA)Ru(II)(en)Cl][PF6] (2, THA = 5,8,9,10-tetrahydroanthracene), and [(η6-DHA)Ru(II)(en)Cl][PF6] (3, DHA = 9,10-dihydroanthracene) with guanine derivatives, in the solid state by X-ray crystallography, and in solution using 2D [1H,1H] NOESY and [1H,15N] HSQC NMR methods. Strong π−π arene-nucleobase stacking is present in the crystal structures of [(η6-C14H14)Ru(en)(9EtG-N7)][PF6]2·(MeOH) (6) and [(η6-C14H12)Ru(en)(9EtG-N7)][PF6]2·2(MeOH) (7) (9EtG = 9-ethylguanine). The anthracene outer ring (C) stacks over the purine base at distances of 3.45 Å for 6 and 3.31 Å for 7, with dihedral angles of 3.3° and 3.1°, respectively. In the crystal structure of [(η6-biphenyl)Ru(en)(9EtG-N7)][PF6]2·(MeOH) (4), there is intermolecular stacking between the pendant phenyl ring and the purine six-membered ring at a distance of 4.0 Å (dihedral angle 4.5°). This stacking stabilizes a cyclic tetramer structure in the unit cell. The guanosine (Guo) adduct [(η6-biphenyl)Ru(en)(Guo-N7)][PF6]2·3.75(H2O) (5) exhibits intramolecular stacking of the pendant phenyl ring with the purine five-membered ring (3.8 Å, 23.8°) and intermolecular stacking of the purine six-membered ring with an adjacent pendant phenyl ring (4.2 Å, 23.0°). These occur alternately giving a columnar-type structure. A syn orientation of arene and purine is present in the crystal structures 5, 6, and 7, while the orientation is anti for 4. However, in solution, a syn orientation predominates for all the biphenyl adducts 4, 5, and the guanosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-GMP) adduct 8 [(η6-biphenyl)Ru(II)(en)(5'-GMP-N7)], as revealed by NMR NOE studies. The predominance of the syn orientation both in the solid state and in solution can be attributed to hydrophobic interactions between the arene and purine rings. There are significant reorientations and conformational changes of the arene ligands in [(η6-arene)Ru(II)(en)(G-N7)] complexes in the solid state, with respect to those of the parent chloro-complexes [(η6-arene)Ru(II)(en)Cl]+. The arene ligands have flexibility through rotation around the arene-Ru π-bonds, propeller twisting for Bip, and hinge-bending for THA and DHA. Thus propeller twisting of Bip decreases by ca. 10° so as to maximize intra- or intermolecular stacking with the purine ring, and stacking of THA and DHA with the purine is optimized when their tricyclic ring systems are bent by ca. 30°, which involves increased bending of THA and a flattening of DHA. This flexibility makes simultaneous arene-base stacking and N7-covalent binding compatible. Strong stereospecific intramolecular H-bonding between an en NH proton oriented away from the arene (en NH(d)) and the C6 carbonyl of G (G O6) is present in the crystal structures of 4, 5, 6, and 7 (average N···O distance 2.8 Å, N−H···O angle 163°). NMR studies of the 5'-GMP adduct 8 provided evidence that en NH(d) protons are involved in strong H-bonding with the 5'-phosphate and O6 of 5'-GMP. The strong H-bonding from G O6 to en NH(d) protons partly accounts for the high preference for binding of {(η6-arene)Ru(II)en}2+ to G versus A (adenine). These studies suggest that simultaneous covalent coordination, intercalation, and stereospecific H-bonding can be incorporated into Ru(II) arene complexes to optimize their DNA recognition behavior, and as potential drug design features."

To systematise them, we combine the classic Sartorian approach to classification with the more recent insights on explanatory typologies, distinguishing between the genus and the different species within it. By drawing on the technique of explanatory typologies to introduce a basic model of policy learning, we identify four major genera in the literature. We then generate variation within each cell by using rigorous concepts drawn from adult education research. By looking at learning through the lenses of knowledge utilisation, we show that the basic model can be expanded to reveal sixteen different species. These types are all conceptually possible, but are not all empirically established in the literature. Our reconstruction of the field sheds light on mechanisms and relations associated with alternative operationalisations of learning and the role of actors in the process of knowledge construction and utilisation. By providing a comprehensive typology, we mitigate concept-stretching problems and lay the foundations for the systematic comparison across and within cases of policy learning."

A recurring structural theme within these molecules is the presence of multiple quaternary stereocenters in close proximity to one another. Over the last decade, we have developed a set of transformations that allow rapid access to polyindolines, a number of which exploit the ability of catalytic levels of palladium to orchestrate carbon–carbon bond formation with impressive levels of regio‐ and stereocontrol. This review tells the story behind the development of this toolbox of synthetic methods, and their validation through the total synthesis of a number of structurally complex cyclotryptamine alkaloids. It also highlights an aspect of asymmetric catalysis that has received little attention, the ability of catalytic asymmetric reactions to selectively elaborate complex, polyfunctional molecules."

Cuticle consists of a cutin matrix as well as cuticular waxes in which very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes are the major components, representing up to 70% of the total wax content in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves. However, despite its major involvement in cuticle formation, the alkane-forming pathway is still largely unknown. To address this deficiency, we report here the characterization of the Arabidopsis ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) gene predicted to encode an enzyme involved in alkane biosynthesis. Analysis of CER1 expression showed that CER1 is specifically expressed in the epidermis of aerial organs and coexpressed with other genes of the alkane-forming pathway. Modification of CER1 expression in transgenic plants specifically affects VLC alkane biosynthesis: waxes of TDNA insertional mutant alleles are devoid of VLC alkanes and derivatives, whereas CER1 overexpression dramatically increases the production of the odd-carbon-numbered alkanes together with a substantial accumulation of iso-branched alkanes. We also showed that CER1 expression is induced by osmotic stresses and regulated by abscisic acid. Furthermore, CER1-overexpressing plants showed reduced cuticle permeability together with reduced soil water deficit susceptibility. However, CER1 overexpression increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CER1 controls alkane biosynthesis and is highly linked to responses to biotic and abiotic stresses."

Reactive intermediates produced by these processes are often α‐oxoaldehydes. The formation of α‐oxoaldehydes enhances and redirects glycating activity in the Maillard reaction since α‐oxoaldehydes are up to 20,000‐fold more reactive than glucose in glycation processes and are predominantly arginine‐directed glycating agents. α‐Oxoaldehydes bypass a requirement for a fructosamine precursor in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) since α‐oxoaldehydes react with proteins (also nucleotides and basic phospholipids) to form AGEs directly. The major AGE formed from α‐oxoaldehydes is generally a hydroimidazolone with other products—although for glyoxal, N ω ‐carboxymethylarginine is a major product. α‐Oxoaldehyde formation also occurs in the absence of an amine substrate, particularly during heat processing of sugar solutions and lipid peroxidation processes—in the latter case, the glycation adducts are advanced lipoxidation products (ALEs). Hydroimidazolones are quantitatively important AGEs in cellular and extracellular proteins in physiological systems. Hydroimidazolone free adducts are liberated by cellular proteolysis and digestion. They are released into blood plasma for urinary excretion. Modification of arginine residues by α‐oxoaldehydes may be particularly damaging since arginine residues have high‐frequency occurrence in ligand and substrate recognition sites in receptor and enzyme active sites. Along with fructosamine formation, α‐oxoaldehyde intermediates of the Maillard reaction represent a major source of damage to the proteome and genome."

This led to solids based on polymerized heptazine or triazine ring units linked by −N═ or −NH– groups. The H content decreased, and the C/N ratio varied between 0.59 and 0.70 with preparation temperatures between 550 and 650 °C due to increased layer condensation. The UV–vis spectra exhibited a strong π–π* transition near 400 nm with a semiconductor-like band edge extending into the visible range. Samples synthesized at 600–650 °C showed an additional absorption near 500 nm that is assigned to n−π* electronic transitions involving the N lone pairs. These are forbidden for planar symmetric s-triazine or heptazine structures but become allowed as increased condensation causes distortion of the polymeric units. Photocatalysis studies showed there was no correlation between the increased visible absorption due to this feature and H2 evolution from methanol used for the anodic reaction. In the absence of any cocatalyst the sample synthesized at 550 °C showed 1.5 μmol h–1 H2 evolution with UV–vis irradiation, but this dropped to ∼0.23 μmol h–1 when the UV spectrum was blocked. Use of a Pt cocatalyst was required to observe H2 evolution from the other samples. Using a more powerful (300 W) lamp led to higher H2 production rates (31.5 μmol h–1) with visible illumination. We suggest the distorted N sites caused by increased polymerization result in electron/hole traps that counter the photocatalytic efficiency. Issues concerning sample porosity are also present. Photocatalytic O2 evolution was determined for RuO2-coated samples using the 300 W lamp with aqueous AgNO3 solution as the sacrificial agent. The materials all showed production rates ∼9 μmol h–1. A highly crystalline compound containing polytriazine structural units ((C3N3)2(NH)3·LiCl) prepared in this study did not show measurable photocatalytic activity."

They facilitate numerous redox reactions in energy storage and conversion systems, enabling the production of chemical feedstock and clean fuels from abundant resources like water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. One major obstacle for their large-scale implementation is the scarcity of cost-effective, durable, and efficient catalysts. A family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) has recently emerged as promising earth-abundant candidates for large-area catalytic energy storage and conversion due to their unique properties of hydrophilicity, high metallic conductivity, and ease of production by solution processing. To take full advantage of these desirable properties, MXenes have been combined with other materials to form MXene hybrids with significantly enhanced catalytic performances beyond the sum of their individual components. MXene hybridization tunes the electronic structure toward optimal binding of redox active species to improve intrinsic activity while increasing the density and accessibility of active sites. This review outlines recent strategies in the design of MXene hybrids for industrially relevant electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic applications such as water splitting, metal-air/sulfur batteries, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. By clarifying the roles of individual material components in the MXene hybrids, we provide design strategies to synergistically couple MXenes with associated materials for highly efficient and durable catalytic applications. We conclude by highlighting key gaps in the current understanding of MXene hybrids to guide future MXene hybrid designs in catalytic energy storage and conversion applications."

A series of insulins, acylated at B29 with fatty acids via glutamic acid spacers, were examined to deduce the structural requirements.Self-association, molecular masses and hexameric conformations of the insulins were studied using size exclusion chromatography monitored by UV or multi-angle light scattering and dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CDS) in environments (changing phenol and zinc concentration) simulating a pharmaceutical formulation and changes following subcutaneous injection.With depletion of phenol, insulin degludec and another fatty diacid-insulin analogue formed high molecular mass filament-like complexes, which disintegrated with depletion of zinc. CDS showed these analogues adopting stable T(3)R(3) conformation in presence of phenol and zinc, changing to T(6) with depletion of phenol. These findings suggest insulin degludec is dihexameric in pharmaceutical formulation becoming multihexameric after injection. The analogues showed weak dimeric association, indicating rapid release of monomers following hexamer disassembly.Insulins can be engineered that remain soluble but become highly self-associated after injection, slowly releasing monomers; this is critically dependent on the acylation moiety. One such analogue, insulin degludec, has therapeutic potential."

In this study, we employed three complementary techniques, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), transient photocurrent spectroscopy (TPC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), to address this issue for one of the most widely studied photoanode systems: nanostructured hematite thin films. For the first time, we show a quantitative agreement between all three techniques. In particular, all three methods show the presence of a recombination process on the 10 ms to 1 s time scale, with the time scale and yield of this loss process being dependent upon applied bias. From comparison of data between these techniques, we are able to assign this recombination phase to recombination of bulk hematite electrons with long-lived holes accumulated at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The data from all three techniques are shown to be consistent with a simple kinetic model based on competition between this, bias dependent, recombination pathway and water oxidation by these long-lived holes. Contrary to most existing models, this simple model does not require the consideration of surface states located energetically inside the band gap. These data suggest two distinct roles for the space charge layer developed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface under anodic bias. Under modest anodic bias (just anodic of flatband), this space charge layer enables the spatial separation of initially generated electrons and holes following photon absorption, generating relatively long-lived holes (milliseconds) at the semiconductor surface. However, under such modest bias conditions, the energetic barrier generated by the space charge layer field is insufficient to prevent the subsequent recombination of these holes with electrons in the semiconductor bulk on a time scale faster than water oxidation. Preventing this back electron-hole recombination requires the application of stronger anodic bias, and is a key reason why the onset potential for photocurrent generation in hematite photoanodes is typically ~500 mV anodic of flat band and therefore needs to be accounted for in electrode design for PEC water splitting."

We consider two alternative surface modifications: a cobalt oxo/hydroxo-based (CoO x ) overlayer, reported previously to function as an efficient water oxidation electrocatalyst, and a Ga 2 O 3 overlayer, reported to passivate hematite surface states. Transient absorption studies of these composite electrodes under applied bias showed that the cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset observed after each of the surface modifications is accompanied by a similar cathodic shift of the appearance of long-lived hematite photoholes, due to a retardation of electron/hole recombination. The origin of the slower electron/hole recombination is assigned primarily to enhanced electron depletion in the Fe 2 O 3 for a given applied bias."

A reduction in solution pH during the reaction was observed mainly due to the complete conversion of S2O8(2-) to sulfate ion together with proton generation. Seven measurable intermediates were found via an oxidation and dimerization process at all tested pH levels. The BHA decay mechanisms are quite different in acidic condition and at other pH levels. There are three unique intermediates that are only detectable at pH 3 via two additional pathways. This is due to the generation of weaker oxidants or radicals which results in a slower degradation of the BHA, and therefore, the accumulation of these intermediates to detectable levels. The rate of BHA decay generally increases from low to high pH levels; however, the corresponding mineralization at higher pH is retarded due to the futile process of recombining radicals and involvement of intermediates. Therefore, neutral pH was suggested to be the optimum condition in terms of mineralization and moderate efficiency in removing BHA."

Surprisingly, this structural transition shows a significant temperature hysteresis: the transition from the open-pored to closed-pored structure occurs at approximately 125 to 150 K, while the transition from the closed-pored to open-pored structure occurs around 325 to 375 K. To our knowledge, this is first observation of such a large temperature hysteresis of a structural transition in metal-organic frameworks.

Furthermore, through the use of advanced characterization techniques such as X‐ray absorption fine structure, positron annihilation spectrometry, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, density‐functional theory calculations, and photocatalytic tests, structure‐activity relationships can be established and used in the rational design of high‐performance LDH‐based photocatalysts for efficient solar energy capture.

Here we have prepared two series of Pd/ZnO catalysts, both by immobilisation of PVA-protected Pd colloids and by Pd impregnation of PdCl2 to investigate structure activity relationships for direct CO2 hydrogenation. Very different performances were found for the different preparation methods, and the Pd loading and pre-reduction of the catalysts were shown to be important factors for optimising methanol yield. The crucial factor for high methanol yield is the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy, either during the reaction itself, or better by high temperature pre-reduction. The formation of the alloy greatly reduces CO production by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalysts prepared by sol-immobilisation were relatively stable to thermal treatment. In contrast, the impregnated catalysts were much less thermally stable, due to the presence of remnant chloride on the surface of the catalyst, which was absent for the case of sol immobilisation preparation. The results illustrate the importance of controlling the PdZn particle size and its surface structure for the catalysts to achieve high methanol selectivity (60%, the rest being CO) and conversion (11%) at 250 °C and 20 bar. Selectivity for sol-immobilised catalysts decreases from 60% at 3 nm average diameter, to 20% at 7 nm."

Heat treated iron and nitrogen containing carbon based materials (Fe–N/C) have shown potential to replace expensive precious metals. Although significant improvements have recently been made, their activity and durability is still unsatisfactory. The further development and a rational design of these materials has stalled due to the lack of an in situ methodology to easily probe and quantify the active site. Here we demonstrate a protocol that allows the quantification of active centres, which operate under acidic conditions, by means of nitrite adsorption followed by reductive stripping, and show direct correlation to the catalytic activity. The method is demonstrated for two differently prepared materials. This approach may allow researchers to easily assess the active site density and turnover frequency of Fe–N/C catalysts."

By making use of the strong σ-donor properties and high steric loading of the B(NDippCH)(2) substituent (Dipp = 2,6-(i)Pr(2)C(6)H(3)), an isolable monomeric species, Si{B(NDippCH)(2)}{N(SiMe(3))Dipp}, can be synthesized which is stable in the solid state up to 130 °C. This silylene species undergoes facile oxidative addition reactions with dihydrogen (at sub-ambient temperatures) and with alkyl C-H bonds, consistent with a low singlet-triplet gap (103.9 kJ mol(-1)), thus demonstrating fundamental modes of reactivity more characteristic of transition metal systems."

Here, we show that the phytohormone ethylene regulates plant development at least in part via alteration of the properties of DELLA protein nuclear growth repressors, a family of proteins first identified as gibberellin (GA) signaling components. This conclusion is based on the following experimental observations. First, ethylene inhibited Arabidopsis root growth in a DELLA-dependent manner. Second, ethylene delayed the GA-induced disappearance of the DELLA protein repressor of ga1-3 from root cell nuclei via a constitutive triple response-dependent signaling pathway. Third, the ethylene-promoted “apical hook” structure of etiolated seedling hypocotyls was dependent on the relief of DELLA-mediated growth restraint. Ethylene, auxin, and GA responses now can be attributed to effects on DELLA function, suggesting that DELLA plays a key integrative role in the phytohormone signal response network."

Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g–1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2–O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed."

In this work, the differences in physical properties between the melt‐derived 45S5 and sol‐gel–derived 58S Bioglass® powders of various particle‐size ranges were studied. The powders were characterized for particle‐size distribution by laser spectrometry, for specific surface area and porosity by nitrogen sorption analysis, and for morphological features by scanning electron microscopy. Melt‐derived 45S5 powders exhibited a low‐porosity texture with surface area in the range 0.15–2.7 m 2 /g. In contrast, the sol‐gel–derived powders exhibited a highly mesoporous texture, with surface area in the range of 126.5–164.7 m 2 /g and a large fraction of 6–9 nm pore sizes. These differences in texture, as well as variations in chemical composition, account for significant changes in the resorption and in vivo responses. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

In all the nonmagnetic bcc metals the most stable SIA defect configuration has the $⟨111⟩$ symmetry. Metals in group 5B of the periodic table (V, Nb, Ta) have significantly different energies of formation of the $⟨111⟩$ and $⟨110⟩$ SIA configurations, while for the group 6B metals (Cr, Mo, W) the two configurations are linked by a soft bending mode. The relative energies of SIA defects in the nonmagnetic bcc metals are fundamentally different from those in ferromagnetic bcc $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-Fe. The systematic trend exhibited by the SIA defect structures in groups 5B and 6B transition metals correlates with the observed thermally activated mobility of SIA defects."

Since these materials are highly porous, the use of the BET theory can be problematic. Several researchers have evaluated the BET method to gain insights into the usefulness of the obtained results and interestingly, their findings are not always consistent. In this review, the suitability of the BET method is discussed for MOFs that have a diverse range of pore widths below the diameters of N 2 or Ar and above 20 Å. In addition, the surface area of MOFs that are obtained by implementing different approaches, such as grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, calculations from the crystal structures or based on experimental N 2 , Ar, or CO 2 adsorption isotherms, are compared and evaluated. Inconsistencies in the state‐of‐the‐art are also noted. Based on the current literature, an overview is provided of how the BET method can give useful estimations of the surface areas for the majority of MOFs, but there are some crucial and specific exceptions which are highlighted in this review."

Halogen-atom transfer remains the most reliable approach to exploit these substrates in radical processes despite its requirement for hazardous reagents and initiators such as tributyltin hydride. In this study, we demonstrate that α-aminoalkyl radicals, easily accessible from simple amines, promote the homolytic activation of carbon-halogen bonds with a reactivity profile mirroring that of classical tin radicals. This strategy conveniently engages alkyl and aryl halides in a wide range of redox transformations to construct sp3-sp3, sp3-sp2, and sp2-sp2 carbon-carbon bonds under mild conditions with high chemoselectivity."

Thus, we study several reactions that have been recently reported to proceed ""in the solid phase"" and clearly show that, in most cases, grinding the two solid reactants together results in the formation of a liquid phase. This is true both for catalytic transformations (e.g., aldol condensations and oligomerization of benzylic compounds) and for noncatalytic reactions (Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, oxidative coupling of naphthols using iron chloride, condensation of amines and aldehydes to form azomethines, homo-etherification of benzylic alcohols using p-toluenesulfonic acid, and nuclear aromatic bromination with NBS). This liquefaction implies the existence of a eutectic mixture with T(fusion) below ambient temperature (although both reagents have higher than ambient melting points). In cases where heating is required, it is again clear that a phase change (from solid to liquid) occurs, explaining the observed reaction kinetics. On the basis of 19 experimental examples, we discuss the possibility of solid-phase organic reactions and the implications of these findings to the reaction between two solid reagents. A general description of such reactive systems is proposed, based on a consideration of the potential for eutectic (or peritectic) formation between the constituents of the liquid phases that arise during the process of mechanical mixing of the solid reagents and products."

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was then investigated on the junction under ambient conditions. The RGO coating dramatically increases Cu 2 O activity for CO 2 photoreduction to result in a nearly six times higher activity than the optimized Cu 2 O and 50 times higher activity than the Cu 2 O/RuO x junction in the 20 th hour. Furthermore, an apparent initial quantum yield of approximately 0.34 % at 400 nm has been achieved by the Cu 2 O/RGO junction for CO 2 photoreduction. The photocurrent of the junction is nearly double that of the blank Cu 2 O photocathode. The improved activity together with the enhanced stability of Cu 2 O is attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer to RGO as well as the protection function of RGO, which was proved by XRD, SEM, TEM, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photo‐electrochemical, photoluminescence, and impedance characterizations. This study further presents useful information for other photocatalyst modification for efficient CO 2 reduction without the need for a noble‐metal co‐catalyst."

Steam cracking remains the most industrially relevant pathway, but other routes for light‐olefin production have emerged. Fluid catalytic cracking only produces ethene in minor concentrations. Challenged by marked catalyst deactivation, in contrast, catalytic dehydrogenation ethane up opens a more selective route to ethene. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, would potentially be the most attractive alternative route because it avoids the need for excessive internal heat input, but also consumes valuable hydrogen. In this Review, the current state of the ODH of ethane is compared with other routes for light‐olefin production, with a focus on the catalyst and reactor system variants. New catalyst systems and reactor designs have been developed to improve the industrial competitiveness of the ODH reaction of ethane. The current state of our fundamental understanding of the ODH of light alkanes, in particular in terms of catalyst and reactor development, is critically reviewed. The proposed mechanisms and the nature of the active site for the ODH reaction are described and discussed in detail for selected promising catalysts. The reported catalytic performance and the possible limitations of these ODH catalysts will be examined and the performance of the emerging approaches is compared to the currently practiced methods."

Conventional methods for activated carbon (AC) synthesis offer limited control of their surface area and porosity, which results in a typical specific capacitance of 70–120 F g −1 in commercial EDLCs based on organic electrolytes and ionic liquids (ILs). Additionally, typical ACs produced from natural precursors suffer from the significant variation of their properties, which is detrimental for EDLC use in automotive applications. A novel method for AC synthesis for EDLCs is proposed. This method is based on direct activation of synthetic polymers. The proposed procedure allowed us to produce ACs with ultrahigh specific surface area of up to 3432 m 2 g −1 and volume of 0.5–4 nm pores up to 2.39 cm 3 g −1 . The application of the produced carbons in EDLCs based on IL electrolyte showed specific capacitance approaching 300 F g −1 , which is unprecedented for carbon materials, and 5–8% performance improvement after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles at the very high current density of 10 A g −1 . The remarkable characteristics of the produced materials and the capability of the fabricated EDLCs to operate safely in a wide electrochemical window at elevated temperatures, suggest that the proposed synthesis route offers excellent potential for large‐scale material production for EDLC use in electric vehicles and industrial applications."

This article summarises a number of previously published applications showing that a form of Transition State Theory (TST) can account for the kinetics of these reactions. New calculations for the emblematic spin-forbidden reaction HC + N2 are also reported. The observed reactivity is determined by two factors. The first is the critical energy required for reaction to occur, which in spin-forbidden reactions is often defined by the relative energy of the Minimum Energy Crossing Point (MECP) between potential energy surfaces corresponding to the different spin states. The second factor is the probability of hopping from one surface to the other in the vicinity of the crossing region, which is largely defined by the spin–orbit coupling matrix element between the two electronic wavefunctions. The spin-forbidden transition state theory takes both factors into account and gives good results. The shortcomings of the theory, which are largely analogous to those of standard TST, are discussed. Finally, it is shown that in cases where the surface-hopping probability is low, the kinetics of spin-forbidden reactions will be characterised by unusually unfavourable entropies of activation. As a consequence, reactions involving a spin-state change can be expected to compete poorly with spin-allowed reactions at high temperatures (or energies)."

The conversion of renewable lignocellulosic biomass into liquid fuels is particularly attractive but extremely challenging due to the inertness and complexity of lignocellulose. Here we describe the direct hydrodeoxygenation of raw woods into liquid alkanes with mass yields up to 28.1 wt% over a multifunctional Pt/NbOPO 4 catalyst in cyclohexane. The superior performance of this catalyst allows simultaneous conversion of cellulose, hemicellulose and, more significantly, lignin fractions in the wood sawdust into hexane, pentane and alkylcyclohexanes, respectively. Investigation on the molecular mechanism reveals that a synergistic effect between Pt, NbO x species and acidic sites promotes this highly efficient hydrodeoxygenation of bulk lignocellulose. No chemical pretreatment of the raw woody biomass or separation is required for this one-pot process, which opens a general and energy-efficient route for converting raw lignocellulose into valuable alkanes."

However, little effort has been devoted to understanding the relationship between the electronic state of metal oxides and a catalyst's properties in Li–S cells. Herein, defect‐rich heterojunction electrocatalysts composed of ultrathin TiO 2‐ x nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for Li–S batteries are reported. Theoretical simulations indicate that oxygen vacancies and heterojunction can enhance electronic conductivity and chemical adsorption. Spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques further indicate that the rich surface vacancies in TiO 2‐ x nanosheets result in highly activated trapping sites for LiPS and lower energy barriers for fast Li ion mobility. Meanwhile, the redistribution of electrons at the heterojunction interfaces realizes accelerated surface electron exchange. Coupled with a polyacrylate terpolymer (LA132) binder, the CNT@TiO 2‐ x –S electrodes exhibit a long cycle life of more than 300 cycles at 1 C and a high area capacity of 5.4 mAh cm −2 . This work offers a new perspective on understanding catalyst design in energy storage devices through band engineering."

As the field matures, there is a need to compartmentalize processes in different spatial localities within vesicles, and for these processes to interact with one another. Here we address this by designing and constructing multi-compartment vesicles within which an engineered multi-step enzymatic pathway is carried out. The individual steps are isolated in distinct compartments, and their products traverse into adjacent compartments with the aid of transmembrane protein pores, initiating subsequent steps. Thus, an engineered signalling cascade is recreated in an artificial cellular system. Importantly, by allowing different steps of a chemical pathway to be separated in space, this platform bridges the gap between table-top chemistry and chemistry that is performed within vesicles."

Noble‐metal‐free catalysts containing Co(Fe)NC moieties have been widely reported in recent years for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction and have also gained noticeable interest for organic transformation. However, to date, no prior studies are available in the literature about the activity of N‐coordinated metal centers for photocatalytic H 2 evolution. Herein, a new photocatalyst containing g‐C 3 N 4 decorated with CoP nanodots constructed from low‐cost precursors is reported. It is for the first time revealed that the unique P(δ − )Co(δ + )N(δ − ) surface bonding states lead to much superior H 2 evolution activity (96.2 µmol h −1 ) compared to noble metal (Pt)‐decorated g‐C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (32.3 µmol h −1 ). The quantum efficiency of 12.4% at 420 nm is also much higher than the record values (≈2%) of other transition metal cocatalysts‐loaded g‐C 3 N 4 .

Efficient depolymerization and deoxygenation of lignin while retaining the aromatic functionality are attractive but extremely challenging. Here we report the selective production of arenes via direct hydrodeoxygenation of organosolv lignin over a porous Ru/Nb 2 O 5 catalyst that enabled the complete removal of the oxygen content from lignin. The conversion of birch lignin to monomer C 7 –C 9 hydrocarbons is nearly quantitative based on its monomer content, with a total mass yield of 35.5 wt% and an exceptional arene selectivity of 71 wt%. Inelastic neutron scattering and DFT calculations confirm that the Nb 2 O 5 support is catalytically unique compared with other traditional oxide supports, and the disassociation energy of C aromatic –OH bonds in phenolics is significantly reduced upon adsorption on Nb 2 O 5 , resulting in its distinct selectivity to arenes. This one-pot process provides a promising approach for improved lignin valorization with general applicability."

This system was tested for potential use as an anode material through the electrooxidation of methanol. Compared to the commercial carbon-supported Pt electrocatalysts, the Pt/RGO showed an unprecedented CO poisoning tolerance, high electrochemical active surface area, and high catalytic mass activity for methanol oxidation reaction, demonstrated by increases of 110, 134, and 60%, respectively. We found that the high concentration of oxygen functional groups on reduced graphene oxide plays a major role on the removal of carbonaceous species on the adjacent Pt sites, underlining a synergetic effect between the oxygen moieties on graphene support and Pt nanoparticles. The present microwave assisted synthesis of Pt/RGO provides a new path to prepare electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activity and CO tolerance, which is of great significance in energy-related applications."

Changes in synthesis conditions lead to millimetre-sized MOF-5 crystals in a high yield. Subsequent carbonization of the MOFs yield HPCs with simultaneously high surface area, up to 2734 m2 g−1, and exceptionally high total pore volume, up to 5.53 cm3 g−1. In the HPCs, micropores are mostly retained and meso- and macro- pores are generated from defects in the individual crystals, which is made possible by structural inheritance from the MOF precursor. The resulting HPCs show a significant amount of CO2 adsorption, over 27 mmol g−1 (119 wt%) at 30 bar and 27 °C, which is one of the highest values reported in the literature for porous carbons. The findings are comparatively analysed with the literature.

Although thoroughly investigated, plant alkane synthesis remains largely undiscovered. The Arabidopsis thaliana ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) protein has been recognized as an essential element of wax alkane synthesis; nevertheless, its function remains elusive. In this study, a screen for CER1 physical interaction partners was performed. The screen revealed that CER1 interacts with the wax-associated protein ECERIFERUM3 (CER3) and endoplasmic reticulum–localized cytochrome b5 isoforms (CYTB5s). The functional relevance of these interactions was assayed through an iterative approach using yeast as a heterologous expression system. In a yeast strain manipulated to produce VLC acyl-CoAs, a strict CER1 and CER3 coexpression resulted in VLC alkane synthesis. The additional presence of CYTB5s was found to enhance CER1/CER3 alkane production. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that CER1 His clusters are essential for alkane synthesis, whereas those of CER3 are not, suggesting that CYTB5s are specific CER1 cofactors. Collectively, our study reports the identification of plant alkane synthesis enzymatic components and supports a new model for alkane production in which CER1 interacts with both CER3 and CYTB5 to catalyze the redox-dependent synthesis of VLC alkanes from VLC acyl-CoAs."

Hierarchically structured zeolites integrate at least two levels of porosity and present the advantages associated with each level of porosity, from selectivity to mass transport. They are categorized into three distinctly different types according to their hierarchical porosities: mesostructured zeolites, macrostructured zeolites, and micro–meso–macroporous structured zeolites. Most importantly, hierarchically structured zeolites offer an effective solution to the mass transport problem associated with conventional zeolites in catalysed reactions because they combine the catalytic features of micropores and the improved accessibility and increased molecular transport related to the addition of several porosities within a single body. In recent years, many strategies have been successfully developed to synthesize hierarchically structured zeolitic materials. This feature article thoroughly summarizes recent developments that have been achieved in the field of hierarchically structured zeolites, with the main focus on the synthesis strategies that are available, with examples given from the literature. Available approaches are reviewed for the preparation of micro–mesoporous structured zeolites, micro–macroporous structured zeolites and micro–meso–macroporous structured zeolites. Furthermore, the enhanced mass transport properties of hierarchically structured zeolites, featuring additional larger pores in addition to the crystalline micropores, have also been described. The significant improvement in catalytic properties in a range of important reactions resulting from enhanced mass transport properties have also been discussed through several representative cases. It is the intent of this work to stimulate intuition into the optimal design of related hierarchically organized zeolites with desired characteristics."

The carbon diffusion on the catalyst surface and the stability of the precursor molecules, ${\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ or ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$, are investigated by ab initio plane wave density functional calculations. We find a low activation energy of 0.4 eV for carbon surface diffusion on Ni and Co (111) planes, much lower than for bulk diffusion. The energy barrier for ${\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ dissociation is at least 1.3 eV and 0.9 eV, respectively, on Ni(111) planes or step edges.

However, the activity still needs further improvement and related fundamentals remain untouched. The fact that spinel oxides tend to form cation deficiencies can differentiate their electrocatalysis from other oxide materials, for example, the most studied oxygen-deficient perovskites. Here, a systematic study of spinel ZnFex Co2-x O4 oxides (x = 0-2.0) toward the OER is presented and a highly active catalyst superior to benchmark IrO2 is developed. The distinctive OER activity is found to be dominated by the metal-oxygen covalency and an enlarged CoO covalency by 10-30 at% Fe substitution is responsible for the activity enhancement. While the pH-dependent OER activity of ZnFe0.4 Co1.6 O4 (the optimal one) indicates decoupled proton-electron transfers during the OER, the involvement of lattice oxygen is not considered as a favorable route because of the downshifted O p-band center relative to Fermi level governed by the spinel's cation deficient nature."

I. Unsupported Catalysts,"Underpotential deposition (upd) of copper has been used to characterize platinum, ruthenium, and platinum−ruthenium high-surface-area unsupported (powder black) electrocatalysts. The surface areas thus obtained compare favorably with those determined by the more conventional electrochemical methods of monolayer CO and hydrogen oxidation. The differing adsorption energies for Cu on either Pt or Ru allow the peaks for upd copper deposited on alloy Pt−Ru to be resolved into their constituent components. Thus, in addition to the surface area, the surface composition of the Pt−Ru electrocatalyst can be determined. This approach distinguishes between bare ruthenium (i.e., metallic) and oxidized ruthenium sites as the upd copper does not deposit on the latter. The ruthenium surface area is found to remain high up to 0.45 V (vs RHE) and then to fall linearly with potential. Polarization at high potentials [1.45 V (vs RHE)] leaves a material in which metallic ruthenium cannot be recovered by electrochemical reduction. This is caused by oxidation of the ruthenium to a state that either dissolves in the aqueous phase and is lost or produces a form of oxidized ruthenium that is in a state that cannot be electrochemically reduced."

Carbon nanotube modified electrodes are examined and compared with boron-doped diamond and glassy carbon electrodes, and most importantly, edge plane and basal pyrolytic graphite electrodes. It is found that CNT modified electrodes are no more reactive than edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes with the comparison with edge plane and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes allowing the electroactive sites for the electrochemical oxidation of NADH to be unambiguously determined as due to edge plane sites. Using these highly reactive edge plane sites, edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes are examined with cyclic voltammetry and amperometry for the electroanalytical determination of NADH. It is demonstrated that a detection limit of 5 microM is possible with cyclic voltammetry or 0.3 microM using amperometry suggesting that edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes can conveniently replace carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes for biosensing applications with the relative advantages of reactivity, cost and simplicity of preparation. We advocate the routine use of edge plane and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes in studies utilising carbon nanotubes particularly if 'electrocatalytic' properties are claimed for the latter."

Biopolymers such as proteins or DNA adopt one-handed conformations, as a result of the chirality of their constituent building blocks. Even at the level of elementary particles, asymmetry exists due to parity violation in the weak nuclear force. While the origin of homochirality in living systems remains obscure, as does the possibility of its connection with broken symmetries at larger or smaller length scales, its centrality to biomolecular structure is clear: the single-handed forms of bio(macro)molecules interlock in ways that depend upon their handednesses. Dynamic artificial systems, such as helical polymers and other supramolecular structures, have provided a means to study the mechanisms of transmission and amplification of stereochemical information, which are key processes to understand in the context of the origins and functions of biological homochirality. Control over stereochemical information transfer in self-assembled systems will also be crucial for the development of new applications in chiral recognition and separation, asymmetric catalysis, and molecular devices.In this Account, we explore different aspects of stereochemistry encountered during the use of subcomponent self-assembly, whereby complex structures are prepared through the simultaneous formation of dynamic coordinative (N → metal) and covalent (N═C) bonds. This technique provides a useful method to study stereochemical information transfer processes within metal–organic assemblies, which may contain different combinations of fixed (carbon) and labile (metal) stereocenters. We start by discussing how simple subcomponents with fixed stereogenic centers can be incorporated in the organic ligands of mononuclear coordination complexes and communicate stereochemical information to the metal center, resulting in diastereomeric enrichment. Enantiopure subcomponents were then incorporated in self-assembly reactions to control the stereochemistry of increasingly complex architectures. This strategy has also allowed exploration of the degree to which stereochemical information is propagated through tetrahedral frameworks cooperatively, leading to the observation of stereochemical coupling across more than 2 nm between metal stereocenters and the enantioselective synthesis of a face-capped tetrahedron containing no carbon stereocenters via a stereochemical memory effect. Several studies on the communication of stereochemistry between the configurationally flexible metal centers in tetrahedral metal–organic cages have shed light on the factors governing this process, allowing the synthesis of an asymmetric cage, obtained in racemic form, in which all symmetry elements have been broken.Finally, we discuss how stereochemical diversity leads to structural complexity in the structures prepared through subcomponent self-assembly. Initial use of octahedral metal templates with facial stereochemistry in subcomponent self-assembly, which predictably gave rise to structures of tetrahedral symmetry, was extended to meridional metal centers. These lower-symmetry linkages have allowed the assembly of a series of increasingly intricate 3D architectures of varying functionality.The knowledge gained from investigating different aspects of the stereochemistry of metal-templated assemblies thus not only leads to new means of structural control but also opens pathways toward functions such as stereoselective guest binding and transformation."

Interestingly, the unusual effect of downsizing the ZIF‐67 crystals and the incorporation of catalytic Co nanoparticles was the spontaneous formation of graphitic networks. The obtained graphitic carbon networks show excellent electrochemical performance for the insertion and extraction of potassium ions."

Its behavior in contact with water plays a critical role in a variety of geochemical and environmental processes. Despite its key role, the details of the aqueous silica interface at the microscopic molecular level are still elusive. Here we provide such a detailed understanding of the molecular behavior of the silica-water interface, using density functional theory based molecular dynamics (DFTMD) simulations, where a consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solvent and surface is provided. We have calculated the acidity of the silanol groups at the interface directly from the DFTMD simulations, without any fitting of parameters to the experimental data. We find two types of silanol groups at the surface of quartz: out-of-plane silanols with a strong acidic character (pKa = 5.6), which consequently results in the formation of strong and short hydrogen bonds with water molecules at the interface, and in-plane silanols with a pKa of 8.5, forming weak hydrogen bonds with the interfacial water molecules. Our estimate of the quartz point of zero charge (1.0) is found in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.9. We have also shown how the silanols orientation and their hydrogen bond properties are responsible for an amphoteric behavior of the surface. A detailed analysis has identified two species of adsorbed water molecules at the solid-liquid interface, which using the language of vibrational spectroscopy can be identified as ""liquid-like"" and ""ice-like"" water or, in other words, water molecules forming respectively weak and strong H-bonds with the oxide surface. These two populations of water are in turn responsible for two distinct peaks in the infrared spectrum of interfacial water and thus provide a molecular explanation of the experimental sum frequency generation spectrum recorded in the literature. In the specific case of quartz, we show that the liquid-/ice-like behavior is the result of the silanol groups ability to donate or accept hydrogen bonds with different strengths, which consequently modulates the vibrational properties of the adsorbed water layer."

Systematic investigation reveals S to have the greatest promotional effect in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) followed by P and that B decreases the activity of N-doped carbons. Experimental and theoretical analyses show the secondary heteroatom promotional effect is impacted by the intrinsic structures and extrinsic surface areas of both materials, i.e., electronic structures exclusively determine the catalytic activity of active sites, while large surface areas optimize apparent HER performance."

Initially, Li is intercalated into Co3O4 up to x ∼ 1.5 Li in LixCo3O4. Thereafter, both materials form a nanocomposite of Co particles imbedded in Li2O, which on subsequent charge forms CoO. The capacities on cycling increase on initial cycles to values exceeding the theoretical value for Co3O4 + 8 Li+ + 8e− → 4 Li2O + 3 Co, 890 mAhg−1, and this is interpreted as due to charge storage in a polymer layer that forms on the high surface area of nanowire and mesoporous Co3O4. After 15 cycles, the capacity decreases drastically for the nanowires due to formation of grains that are separated one from another by a thick polymer layer, leading to electrical isolation. In contrast, the mesoporous Co3O4 losses its mesoporosity and forms a morphology similar to bulk Co3O4 (Co particles imbedded in Li2O matrix) with which it exhibits a similar capacity on cycling. In contrast to mesoporous lithium intercalation compounds, which show superior capacity at high rates compared to bulk materials, mesoporosity does not seem to improve the capacity of conversion reactions on extended cycling. If, however, mesoporosity could be retained during the conversion reaction, then higher capacities could be obtained in such systems."

We have analysed time-slice simulations from 17 global models, participating in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP), to explore changes in present-day (2000) hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration and methane (CH4) lifetime relative to preindustrial times (1850) and to 1980. A comparison of modeled and observation-derived methane and methyl chloroform lifetimes suggests that the present-day global multi-model mean OH concentration is overestimated by 5 to 10% but is within the range of uncertainties. The models consistently simulate higher OH concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) compared with the Southern Hemisphere (SH) for the present-day (2000; inter-hemispheric ratios of 1.13 to 1.42), in contrast to observation-based approaches which generally indicate higher OH in the SH although uncertainties are large. Evaluation of simulated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, the primary sink for OH, against ground-based and satellite observations suggests low biases in the NH that may contribute to the high north–south OH asymmetry in the models. The models vary widely in their regional distribution of present-day OH concentrations (up to 34%). Despite large regional changes, the multi-model global mean (mass-weighted) OH concentration changes little over the past 150 yr, due to concurrent increases in factors that enhance OH (humidity, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and UV radiation due to decreases in stratospheric ozone), compensated by increases in OH sinks (methane abundance, carbon monoxide and non-methane volatile organic carbon (NMVOC) emissions). The large inter-model diversity in the sign and magnitude of preindustrial to present-day OH changes (ranging from a decrease of 12.7% to an increase of 14.6%) indicate that uncertainty remains in our understanding of the long-term trends in OH and methane lifetime. We show that this diversity is largely explained by the different ratio of the change in global mean tropospheric CO and NOx burdens (ΔCO/ΔNOx, approximately represents changes in OH sinks versus changes in OH sources) in the models, pointing to a need for better constraints on natural precursor emissions and on the chemical mechanisms in the current generation of chemistry-climate models. For the 1980 to 2000 period, we find that climate warming and a slight increase in mean OH (3.5 ± 2.2%) leads to a 4.3 ± 1.9% decrease in the methane lifetime. Analysing sensitivity simulations performed by 10 models, we find that preindustrial to present-day climate change decreased the methane lifetime by about four months, representing a negative feedback on the climate system. Further, we analysed attribution experiments performed by a subset of models relative to 2000 conditions with only one precursor at a time set to 1860 levels. We find that global mean OH increased by 46.4 ± 12.2% in response to preindustrial to present-day anthropogenic NOx emission increases, and decreased by 17.3 ± 2.3%, 7.6 ± 1.5%, and 3.1 ± 3.0% due to methane burden, and anthropogenic CO, and NMVOC emissions increases, respectively."

The materials are built from C- and N-containing heterocycles with heptazine or triazine rings linked via sp2-bonded N atoms (N(C)3 units) or -NH- groups. The electronic, chemical and optical functionalities are determined by the nature of the local to extended structures as well as the chemical composition of the materials. Because of their typically amorphous to nanocrystalline nature and variable composition, significant challenges remain to fully assess and calibrate the structure-functionality relationships among carbon nitride materials. It is also important to devise a useful and consistent approach to naming the different classes of carbon nitride compounds that accurately describes their chemical and structural characteristics related to their functional performance.

This review summarizes the important role played by organometallic chemistry in the recent development of SMMs. The broad applicability of organometallic synthesis has led to a series of organometallic SMMs containing transition metals, lanthanides, or actinides, with several examples accounting for some of the most fascinating low-temperature magnetism. The review has two main aims. The first aim is to provide organometallic chemists with an introduction to one of the most exciting areas of modern molecular magnetism and, in particular, to highlight how organometallic chemistry has allowed the field to evolve in new directions. The second aim is more of a clarion call: organometallic chemistry still has hugely underexploited potential in the development of single-molecule magnets, and it is reasonable to expect that different synthetic approaches will lead to new and unusual magnetic phenomena. By using this review as an entry point for studying the literature in more detail, hopefully more organometallic chemists will consider directing their synthetic repertoire toward the design and realization of new, and possibly improved, single-molecule magnets."

The nanoparticles were then assembled on an Au surface to form a film with high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A Tafel slope of 69 mV per decade was measured for this film and the onset potential was estimated to be −0.09 V. The small loading (1.03 μg cm−2) and the high current density (0.92 mA cm−2 at η = 0.15 V) demonstrated extremely high catalytic efficiency. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic results revealed that the assembled nanoparticle film was sulfur enriched with abundant S edges and a structural rearrangement of the S rich particles might occur during the self-assembly process, resulting in significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER. Electrochemical impedance measurements suggested that the assembling process optimized the conductivity of the nanoparticle film, which contributed to the enhanced HER catalytic activity. Our research has provided a new way to synthesize active molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles for HER and a new approach to achieve enrichment of S edges on molybdenum sulfide, which might have potential use not only for electrocatalytic HER, but also for photoelectrocatalytic HER and plasmon-enhanced water splitting."

The behavior of two ionic liquids has been compared, namely 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride and 1,3-dimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate. The hexafluorophosphate ionic liquids are known to be more hydrophobic as solvents than the corresponding chloride liquids. This is manifested in our simulations by differences in the signs of both the excess volumes and the enthalpies of mixing. However, there is surprisingly little difference in the microscopic properties. In both liquids, water molecules tend to be isolated from each other in mixtures with more ions than water molecules. When the molar proportion of water molecules reaches 75%, a percolating network of waters is found as well as some isolated molecules and small clusters. In all cases, molecular motion becomes faster as the proportion of water increases, although there are some differences in the details of the translational and rotational motion."

Owing to the good agreement observed between simulation and experimental data, the simulation results can be used to identify preferential adsorption sites, which are located close to the organic linkers.

The anti‐inflammatory properties of HO‐1 are related to inhibition of adhesion molecule expression and reduction of oxidative stress, while exogenous CO gas treatment decreases the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and nitric oxide (NO). CO‐releasing molecules (CO‐RMs) are a novel group of substances identified by our group that are capable of modulating physiological functions via the liberation of CO. We aimed in this study to examine the potential anti‐inflammatory characteristics of CORM‐2 and CORM‐3 in an in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐stimulated murine macrophages. Stimulation of RAW264.7 macrophages with LPS resulted in increased expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and production of nitrite. CORM‐2 or CORM‐3 (10–100 μ M ) reduced nitrite generation in a concentration‐dependent manner but did not affect the protein levels of iNOS. CORM‐3 also decreased nitrite levels when added 3 or 6 h after LPS exposure. CORM‐2 or CORM‐3 did not cause any evident cytotoxicity and produced an increase in HO‐1 expression and heme oxygenase activity; this effect was completely prevented by the thiol donor N ‐acetylcysteine. CORM‐3 also considerably reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor‐ α , another mediator of the inflammatory response. The inhibitory effects of CORM‐2 and CORM‐3 were not observed when the inactive compounds, which do not release CO, were coincubated with LPS. These results indicate that CO liberated by CORM‐2 and CORM‐3 significantly suppresses the inflammatory response elicited by LPS in cultured macrophages and suggest that CO carriers can be used as an effective strategy to modulate inflammation.

We present a biocatalytic hydrogen-borrowing amination of primary and secondary alcohols that allows for the efficient and environmentally benign production of enantiopure amines. The method relies on a combination of two enzymes: an alcohol dehydrogenase (from Aromatoleum sp., Lactobacillus sp., or Bacillus sp.) operating in tandem with an amine dehydrogenase (engineered from Bacillus sp.) to aminate a structurally diverse range of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, yielding up to 96% conversion and 99% enantiomeric excess. Primary alcohols were aminated with high conversion (up to 99%).

Our approach consists of the iterative combination of small building blocks through the use of boron chemistry to essentially ""grow"" molecules. This approach, which we term assembly-line synthesis (ALS), resembles the way that nature assembles natural products (e.g., the polyketide synthase machinery) and has the advantage that many structural variations can be easily introduced and the products can be evaluated in structural or biological contexts. Chiral boronic esters have been recognized as valuable building blocks due to their unique chemical properties. They are both chemically and configurationally stable, and they can be prepared with very high levels of enantioselectivity. Additionally they undergo a broad array of transformations that lead to the stereocontrolled formation of C-C and C-X (X = heteroatom) bonds. This versatility makes boronic acids ideal building blocks for iterative molecular assembly. A powerful reaction platform for chemical diversification using chiral boronic esters is their homologation using lithium carbenoids via 1,2-metalate rearrangement. In the 1980s, Matteson described the use of boronic esters bearing a chiral diol in a two-step homologation process with dichloromethyl lithium and Grignard reagents (substrate-controlled approach). We have focused on reagent control and have found that Hoppe's chiral lithiated carbamates can be used as carbenoid equivalents in conjunction with achiral boronic esters. This reagent-controlled process offers many advantages due to the easy access of both the chiral lithiated carbamates and stable boronic esters. The carbamates can be derived from primary or secondary alcohols, and a broad range of functionalized boronic esters and boranes can be employed. Multiple homologations can be carried out in a one-pot sequence thereby streamlining the process to a single operation. This methodology has enabled the synthesis of many molecules containing multiple contiguous stereogenic centers with exquisite 3-D control. In this Account, we trace our own studies to establish the lithiation-borylation methodology and describe selected synthetic applications."

A supported metal catalyst (Ni/Al 2 O 3 ) reduced in a methane discharge is fully packed into the discharge region. The influence of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst packed into the gas gap on the electrical characteristics of the discharge is investigated. The introduction of the catalyst pellets leads to a transition in discharge behaviour from a typical filamentary microdischarge to a combination of spatially limited microdischarges and a predominant surface discharge on the catalyst surface. It is also found that the breakdown voltage of the CH 4 /CO 2 discharge significantly decreases when the reduced catalyst is fully packed in the discharge area. Conductive Ni active sites dispersed on the catalyst surface contribute to the expansion of the discharge and enhancement of charge transfer. In addition, plasma-catalytic dry reforming of CH 4 is carried out with the reduced Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst using a mixing ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 = 1 and a total flow rate of 50 ml min −1 . An increase in H 2 selectivity is observed compared with dry CH 4 reforming with no catalyst, while the H 2 /CO molar ratio significantly increases from 0.84 to 2.53 when the catalyst is present."

All interion interactions were taken into account by explicitly modeling the entire liquid structure using classical MD, followed by DFT computations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies. The relative cathodic and anodic limits of BMIM PF6, BMIM BF4, BMIM TFSI, and P13 TFSI obtained from our approach are in fairly good agreement with existing experimental data. From our DFT calculations, we also obtained the cation- and anion-projected density of states (DOS), which provide information on the likely species contributing to reductive and oxidative decomposition. Our predictions support Howlett et al.’s earlier finding(1) that the TFSI anion is less stable than the P13 cation against reduction. In addition, our results provide surprising evidence of possible cation anodic instability; we predict the aromatic BMIM cation to be less stable against oxidation than the respective anions in BMIM PF6 and BMIM BF4, and the P13 cation to be less stable against oxidation than the PF6 anion in P13 PF6. We also present a comparison of the predictions of our approach with that of simpler approximations based on in vacuo or polarizable continuum model calculations."

A series of nanostructured rods and cubes with different physico–chemical properties have been synthesized, characterized and tested in the total toluene oxidation. The variation of the temperature and base concentration during the hydrothermal syntheses of nanostructured ceria leads not only to different ceria morphologies with high shape purity, but also to structures with tuneable surface areas and defect concentrations. Ceria nanorods present a higher surface area and a higher concentration of bulk and surface defects than nanocubes associated with their exposed crystal planes, leading to high oxidation activities. However, for a given morphology, the catalytic activity for toluene oxidation is directly related to the concentration of surface oxygen defects and not the overall concentration of oxygen vacancies as previously believed."

Here, we define the relationship between the plant stress hormone ethylene and the timing of floral initiation. Ethylene signaling is activated by diverse environmental stresses, but it was not previously clear how ethylene regulates flowering. First, we show that ethylene delays flowering in Arabidopsis, and that this delay is partly rescued by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the DELLAs, a family of nuclear gibberellin (GA)-regulated growth-repressing proteins. This finding suggests that ethylene may act in part by modulating DELLA activity. We also show that activated ethylene signaling reduces bioactive GA levels, thus enhancing the accumulation of DELLAs. Next, we show that ethylene acts on DELLAs via the CTR1-dependent ethylene response pathway, most likely downstream of the transcriptional regulator EIN3. Ethylene-enhanced DELLA accumulation in turn delays flowering via repression of the floral meristem-identity genes LEAFY (LFY) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1). Our findings establish a link between the CTR1/EIN3-dependent ethylene and GA-DELLA signaling pathways that enables adaptively significant regulation of plant life cycle progression in response to environmental adversity."

The electrochemical response of the ionic liquid is also characterised and it is shown that chromium can be electrodeposited efficiently to yield a crack-free deposit. This approach could circumvent the use of chromic acid for chromium electroplating, which would be a major environmental benefit. This method of using hydrated metal salts to form ionic liquids is shown to be valid for a variety of other salt mixtures with choline chloride."

In these systems, soluble dimeric or oligomeric intermediates are typically released via interfacial biocatalysis, and additional enzymes often process the soluble intermediates into monomers for microbial uptake. The recent discovery of a two-enzyme system for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) deconstruction, which employs one enzyme to convert the polymer into soluble intermediates and another enzyme to produce the constituent PET monomers (MHETase), suggests that nature may be evolving similar deconstruction strategies for synthetic plastics. This study on the characterization of the MHETase enzyme and synergy of the two-enzyme PET depolymerization system may inform enzyme cocktail-based strategies for plastics upcycling."

Substitution for a methyl group at the 2-position of the cation to form 1-butyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium ([C4C1mim]+) eliminates the main hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Cl anion and the imidazolium cation. Loss of this hydrogen-bonding interaction could be expected to lead to a reduction in melting point and a decrease in viscosity; however the opposite is observed experimentally; melting points and viscosity increase. The gas-phase structure and electronic properties of ion pairs formed from [C4C1mim]+ and Cl- are investigated to offer insight into this counter-intuitive behavior. We hypothesize that the effects due to a loss in hydrogen bonding are outweighed by those due to a loss in entropy. The amount of disorder in the system is reduced in two ways: elimination of ion-pair conformers, which are stable for [C4C1im]Cl but not [C4C1mim]Cl, and an increase in the rotational barrier of the butyl chain, which limits free rotation and facilitates alkyl chain association. The reduction in entropy leads to greater ordering within the liquid raising the melting point and increasing viscosity. The relative stabilities of 15 conformers with respect to anion position and alkyl chain rotation are reported at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level for [C4C1mim]Cl. Hydrogen bonding between the cation and the anion is examined on the basis of structural criteria and the computed vibrational spectra (IR and Raman). Spectra for the substituted and unsubstituted cations and ion pairs are compared, and modes are identified for [C4C1mim]Cl that could be used to differentiate between rotational conformers. A natural bond orbital analysis has also been carried out, and the resultant charge distribution is compared with that of the unsubstituted analogue [C4C1im]Cl."

We have developed a reliable method that generates diazo compounds in situ. Our approach is based on the Bamford–Stevens reaction, which utilizes tosylhydrazone salts as diazo precursors. In the presence of phase‐transfer‐catalysts (PTC), we found that tosylhydrazone salts can be cleanly converted to diazo compounds under mild reaction conditions and in a wide range of solvents. These diazo compounds can then be induced to react directly with alkenes or alkynes to synthesize pyrazoles or with aldehydes to generate ketones. Alternatively, diazo compounds can react with transition metals capable of carbene transfer reactions.

The bimetallic complexes displayed exceptionally high catalytic activity and in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide could catalyse cyclic carbonate synthesis at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Catalyst-reuse experiments demonstrated that one bimetallic complex was stable for over 60 reactions, though the tetrabutylammonium bromide decomposed in situ by a retro-Menschutkin reaction to form tributylamine and had to be regularly replaced. The mild reaction conditions allowed a full analysis of the reaction kinetics to be carried out and this showed that the reaction was first order in aluminium complex concentration, first order in epoxide concentration, first order in carbon dioxide concentration (except when used in excess) and unexpectedly second order in tetrabutylammonium bromide concentration. Further kinetic experiments demonstrated that the tributylamine formed in situ was involved in the catalysis and that addition of butyl bromide to reconvert the tributylamine into tetrabutylammonium bromide resulted in inhibition of the reaction. The reaction kinetics also indicated that no kinetic resolution of racemic epoxides was possible with this class of catalysts, even when the catalyst was derived from a chiral salen ligand.

The extreme rigidity of this polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-Trip-TB) facilitates gas permeability data that lie well above the benchmark 2008 Robeson upper bounds for the important O2/N2 and H2/N2 gas pairs. Polymer membranes are of increasing importance for a range of molecular separations due to their potential for enhanced energy-efficiency over competing technologies.1 For example, gas separation using polymer membranes is an established industrial technology that is applied to O2 or N2 enrichment of air, natural gas upgrading (i.e., predominantly removing CO2 from CH4), and hydrogen recovery from ammonia manufacture (separating H2 from N2).2 In addition, polymer membranes are also predicted to play an increasing role in hydrogen production (e.g., separating H2 from CO2)3 and post-combustion capture of CO2 (separating CO2 from N2).4 For any gas separation membrane it is desirable to have good selectivity for one gas over another, combined with high permeability (i.e., flux or throughput). Generally, polymers used for commercial gas separation membranes demonstrate high selectivity but low permeability, however, to compete with other technologies for very large-scale applications, membrane materials with greatly enhanced gas permeabilities are desirable.5 Unfortunately, for the separation of a given gas pair (x and y), highly permeable polymers display inadequate selectivity due to the well-established trade-off between permeability (Px) and selectivity (αxy = Px/Py). For example, one of the most permeable polymers, poly(trimethylsilylpropyne), has very poor selectivity (e.g., PO2 = 6000 Barrer; αO2/N2 = 1.8).6 The permeability-selectivity trade-off was quantified by Robeson in 1991,7 and revised in 2008,8 by plotting log Px versus log αxy for a large number of polymers. For each gas pair, an ""upper bound"" was identified and the position of the gas permeability data relative to the upper bound is used as a universal performance indicator when assessing the potential of a new polymer as a membrane material for the separation of the two gases. The position of the Robeson upper bound for each gas pair is related to the difference in the kinetic diameter of the gas molecules and the size-sieving nature (i.e., diffusivity selectivity) of the rigid glassy polymers that define it.9 Theory suggests that greater selectivity can be obtained by suppressing polymer motion by increasing chain rigidity whereas high gas permeability relies on the generation of a large amount of free volume through large inter-chain separation.[9] Conforming to these design criteria, Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs), such as the archetypal PIM-1 (Figure 1a), are a class of membrane-forming polymer that are designed to possess a wholly fused-ring structure to restrict chain motion and a contorted chain structure to prohibit space efficient packing.10 Hence, gas permeability data for PIMs generally lie over the 1991 upper bound for most important gas pairs and some approach, or even exceed, the 2008 upper bounds (Figure 2).11 Recently, we introduced a new class of PIM prepared using a polymerisation reaction based on the efficient formation of the bridged bicyclic diamine called Tröger's base (TB; i.e., 6H,12H-5,11-methanodibenzo[b,f][1,5]diazocine).12 For example, the reaction of 2,6(7)-diamino-9,10-dimethylethanoanthracene yields the highly rigid ladder polymer (PIM-EA-TB) (Figure 1b). PIM-EA-TB demonstrates very fast gas permeability and good selectivity so that its data lie well above the 2008 upper bounds for O2/N2 (Figure 2a), H2/N2 (Figure 2b), H2/CH4 and H2/CO2 due to exceptional diffusivity selectivity that favours the transport of gas molecules of smaller kinetic diameters (e.g., H2 = 2.8; CO2 = 3.3; O2 = 3.46 Å) over that of larger molecules (e.g., N2 = 3.64; CH4 = 3.87 Å).[12] This enhanced molecular sieving performance of PIM-EA-TB was attributed to its highly rigid macromolecular structure, which does not contain the relatively flexible spiro-centres or dioxin linkages found in conventional PIMs such as PIM-1.13 Anomalously, the permeability data of PIM-EA-TB for the technologically important gas pairs of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 proved unremarkable relative to that of other PIMs and fall below the 2008 upper bounds (Figure 2b and c).[12] Here we report the properties of a novel triptycene-based PIM prepared via Tröger's base formation that demonstrates further enhancement of gas permeability data for O2/N2 and performance near the 2008 upper bounds for the CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 gas pairs.14 PIM-EA-TB was designed to possess extreme rigidity being composed solely of benzene rings fused to alternating TB and ethanoanthracene bridged bicyclic units. Therefore, it is a challenge to reduce polymer chain mobility still further. However, one possible enhancement to the polymer design is the removal of the methyl substituents at the bridgehead of the ethanoanthracene unit as their turnstile-like rotary thermal motion may reduce the gas selectivity of PIM-EA-TB by facilitating transport of larger gas molecules through narrow elements of free volume that would otherwise be inaccessible. These methyl groups were originally envisioned to increase the distance between polymer chains of PIM-EA-TB to ensure high permeability. Instead, triptycene was considered as a desirable alternative bicyclic building unit as it has been used extensively to generate free volume and intrinsic microporosity within polymers.15 The use of triptycene, to give PIM-Trip-TB (Figure 1c), was anticipated to maintain inter-chain distances, without the need for bridgehead methyl substituents. PIM-Trip-TB is prepared in three simple steps from commercially available triptycene. The final step involves polymerisation of 2,6(7)-diaminotriptycene16 by reaction with six equivalents of dimethoxymethane in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at ambient temperature. The resulting polymer is soluble in chloroform allowing for analysis by Gel Permeation Chromato­graphy (GPC) which indicates that a reasonably high average molecular mass was achieved (Mn = 21 000; Mw = 50 000; calibrated relative to polystyrene standards). An apparent BET (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) surface area of 899 m2 g−1 could be calculated from the N2 isotherm for a powdered sample of PIM-Trip-TB at 77 K,17 which is less that that obtained for the related polymer PIM-EA-TB (1028 m2 g−1) but higher than the range quoted for PIM-1 (720–820 m2 g−1) in the literature.[10],18 The fabrication of optically clear films suitable for gas permeability studies was achieved by casting from chloroform solution. Films of PIM-Trip-TB proved robust with a Young's modulus of 1206 ± 42 MPa and tensile strength of 44.6 ± 5.2 MPa, which are an improvement on the equivalent values for PIM-EA-TB,[12] and maximum deformation of 13.0 ± 8.2%. The gas permeabilities of a film of PIM-Trip-TB of 132 μm thickness are given in Table 1 together with the corresponding values for a thicker film of PIM-EA-TB (182 μm), which are similar to those recently reported.[12] Prior to analysis both films were treated by immersion in methanol as this is known to reverse the effects of physical ageing for glassy ultra-permeable polymers and also removes the last residues of the casting solvent.[10] Hence, this treatment allows a direct comparison between the gas permeabilities of the different polymers in an unaged state. The order of gas permeabilities for the freshly methanol treated film of PIM-Trip-TB is CO2>H2>O2>He>CH4>N2, which is different from that of PIM-EA-TB (H2>CO2>He>O2>CH4>N2) but similar to most other PIMs. Greater values of gas permeabilities are obtained for PIM-Trip-TB over PIM-EA-TB with the exception of He and H2, which are similar. This enhancement is particularly notable as the film of PIM-Trip-TB was thinner than that of PIM-EA-TB and, generally for glassy polymers, the gas permeabilities for thinner films are lower due to the larger relative contribution of the more densely packed surface regions of the film.[11],19 Of particular interest is the greater CO2 permeability for PIM-Trip-TB. In addition, ideal selectivities for PIM-Trip-TB are significantly higher than those of PIM-EA-TB for some important gas pairs (O2/N2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2) whilst similar for others (H2/N2, H2/CO2 and H2/CH4). Hence, the permeability data for PIM-Trip-TB are well above the Robeson upper bounds for O2/N2 (Figure 2a), H2/N2 (Figure 2b), H2/CH4 and H2/CO2. In particular, the strong enhancement in O2/N2 performance vindicates the choice of triptycene as a structural unit to enhance diffusivity selectivity as the separation of this gas pair relies almost exclusively on size selectivity based on only a small difference in kinetic dia­meter between the gas molecules. Importantly, the PIM-Trip-TB data for CO2/CH4 (Figure 2c) and CO2/N2 (Figure 2d), both lie very close to the respective 2008 upper bounds in contrast to that of PIM-EA-TB, which fall well below. Physical ageing (i.e., loss of free volume over time) is a general feature of glassy polymers20 and is observed for both PIM-Trip-TB and PIM-EA-TB (Table 1). The rate of ageing is more rapid in thinner films and therefore, to allow direct comparison, the values quoted are for a 60% reduction of the original value of PO2, which occurs after 100 days following methanol treatment for the thinner film of PIM-Trip-TB (132 μm) and 470 days for that of PIM-EA-TB (180 μm). PIM-Trip-TB ages gracefully with a corresponding enhancement of selectivity for the reduction in permeability so that lines joining the non-aged and aged data points on all the Robeson plots are approximately parallel to the upper bound for all important gas pairs (Figure 2). For the O2/N2 gas pair, the selectivity in favour of O2 of 5.7 for a value of PO2 greater than 1000 Barrer is exceptional. In addition, the data for the aged film of PIM-EA-TB crosses the 2008 upper bound for CO2/CH4 (Figure 2c) and is comparable with the data of the best performing PIMs for this commercially important gas pair.[11] According to the solution-diffusion model the permeability of a gas through a dense polymer is dependent on both its diffusivity (Dx) and its solubility (Sx) (i.e., Px = DxSx).21 Generally, the observed enhancement in performance for PIM-Trip-TB as compared to PIM-EA-TB appears to be due to greater diffusivity selectivity as determined by analysis of the data obtained by the time-lag method for measuring gas permeabilities. This is consistent with the higher chain stiffness as expressed in a higher Young's modulus. In order to investigate the mechanism of transport in these two polymers further, CO2, CH4 and N2 sorption isotherms were obtained at 25 °C (Figure 3a). The uptake of ∼20% (∼4 mmol g−1) by mass of CO2 at 0.7 MPa for these TB-based polymers is impressive as compared to other micro­porous polymers examined for CO2 adsorption.17, 22 Interestingly, the sorption of CO2, CH4 and N2 within PIM-Trip-TB is higher at relatively low pressures (0.1–0.3 MPa) as compared to PIM-EA-TB, thus contributing to their higher solubility coefficients and, hence, gas permeabilities at the feed pressure of 0.1 MPa (Table 1). In contrast, the sorption of CO2 and CH4 is greater at higher pressures (>0.3 MPa) for PIM-EA-TB relative to PIM-Trip-TB (Figure 3b). This difference in sorption behaviour indicates that PIM-Trip-TB has a higher proportion of smaller free volume elements that are capable of binding to gas molecules at lower pressures than does PIM-EA-TB, which is consistent with its enhanced size-sieving properties. Despite the clear enhancement noted for Trip-PIM-TB, the performance of both TB polymers appears anomalous for gas pairs involving CO2 with the expected benefits of enhanced diffusivity selectivity, which are obvious for other gas pairs, not being fully realised for CO2/CH4 or CO2/N2. In particular, the apparent diffusivity selectivity in favour of N2 over CO2 within unaged films of both Trip-PIM-TB and PIM-EA-TB (Table 1) is unusual and suggests that some of the free volume of PIM-EA-TB is blocked for CO2 transport but available for N2 and other gases. It is known that adsorbed water adversely effects the gas permeability of PIM-1[10] and therefore, to determine whether its presence may be influencing the performance of the TB polymers, IR spectroscopic analysis was carried out on films of PIM-EA-TB and PIM-Trip-TB following methanol treatment. Characteristic absorption bands of H2O at 3200–3600 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 were observed in the spectrum of both films (Figure SI 1). In addition, a relatively strong and sharp band at 3650 cm−1 can be assigned to the presence of hydroxide anion, consistent with the basic nature of the TB units within the polymers.23, 24 Prior to the gas permeability measurements, the polymer films were subjected to reduced pressure (10−2 mbar) and hence, the IR spectra of films following a similar protocol were also collected. A distinct difference between the spectra of the resulting two films was observed with that of PIM-Trip-TB showing a large reduction (∼95%) in the intensity of the broad water peak centred at 3400 cm−1 whereas the intensity of the same peak for PIM-EA-TB is reduced by only ∼35%. Similarly, after exposure to reduced pressure, the intensity of the peak attributed to the hydroxide anion at ∼3650 cm−1 is reduced to 20% of its original intensity for PIM-Trip-TB but it is unchanged for PIM-EA-TB. Hence, the anomalously low permeability of CO2 relative to that of other gases may be due to its specific interaction with adsorbed water and associated hydroxide anions to form bicarbonate anions that will occupy free volume and reduce diffusivity. This behaviour is similar to that noted for another recently reported amine-containing PIM.25 However, PIM-Trip-TB appears to offer an additional advantage over PIM-EA-TB in that it is less hydroscopic and therefore water does not have such a significant effect on its CO2 permeability. To conclude, PIM-Trip-TB provides highly impressive data for a number of commercially relevant gas pairs including O2/N2, H2/N2 and CO2/CH4 in terms of permeability, selectivity and position relative to the Robeson upper bound. This performance is based on exceptional diffusivity selectivity of gas transport. The lack of methyl groups in PIM-Trip-TB may enhance performance as compared to PIM-EA-TB, within which methyl rotary motion may reduce diffusivity selectivity. Indeed, as PIM-Trip-TB is a ladder polymer that is composed of only benzene rings fused together by rigid bridged bicyclic units and contains no groups that can act as rotors, its performance as a molecular sieve is likely to be approaching the optimum achievable for gas separation for a solution processable polymer. Any further improvement in fundamental gas permeability data may require the additional enhancement of solubility selectivity for one gas over another. Preparation of PIM-Trip-TB: A mixture of 2,6(7)-diaminotriptycene (1.43 g, 5.0 mmol), dimethoxymethane (2.60 g, 34.2 mmol) and dichloromethane (1.5 mL) was added dropwise to trifluoroacetic acid (15 mL) over 2 hours. The clear red solution was left stirring for 168 hours and the reaction quenched with water (100 mL). Aqueous ammonia (35%, 100 mL) was added and the mixture stirred vigorously for 2 hours before the precipitate was collected by filtration. The solid was washed with water (100 mL) and acetone (100 mL), dried and ground to a fine powder. The polymer was dissolved in chloroform (150 mL), reprecipitated with hexane (150 mL) and collected by filtration. This process was repeated twice. The solid was then refluxed in acetone and twice in methanol, each time for 16 hours. Filtration gave the polymer as a cream powder (1.28 g, 79%). Apparent BET surface area of powder = 899 m2 g−1; total pore volume = 0.55 ml g−1 at p/po = 0.98; TGA (nitrogen): weight loss due to thermal degradation started at 400 °C and totalled 30.5%; GPC (from chloroform solution and calibrated against polystyrene standards) Mn = 21,200, Mw = 50,700 g mol−1; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 3.89 (br s, 2H), 4.41 (br s, 2H), 4.80 (br s, 2H), 5.07 (br s, 2H), 6.97 (br m, 8H). Procedures: Film formation was achieved by preparing a solution of PIM-Trip-TB (0.50 g) in chloroform (20 mL) which was poured into a 9 cm circular Teflon mould. The film was allowed to form by slow solvent evaporation for 96 h. Prior to permeability measurements the films were soaked in methanol for 8 h to remove residual casting solvent and then dried in air. The density of the 132 μm film, measured by simple geometric means, was found to be 1.14 ± 0.04 g cm−3 after MeOH soaking. Gas permeation tests of single gases were carried out at 25 °C and at a feed pressure of 1 bar, using a fixed-volume pressure increase instrument, described elsewhere,26 with details given in the Supplemental Information. Before analysis the membrane samples were carefully evacuated to remove previously dissolved species using a vacuum pump fitted with a trap to remove oil. The gases were tested in the following order: He, H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO2. An effective membrane area of 2.14 cm2 was used.

The use of hydrocarbons in high temperature fuel cells is achieved through either external or internal reforming. Reforming and partial oxidation catalysis to convert hydrocarbons to hydrogen rich syngas plays an important role in fuel processing technology. The current research in the area of reforming and partial oxidation of methane, methanol and ethanol includes catalysts for reforming and oxidation, methods of catalyst synthesis, and the effective utilization of fuel for both external and internal reforming processes. In this paper the recent progress in these areas of research is reviewed along with the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, from this an overview of the current best performing catalysts for the reforming and partial oxidizing of hydrocarbons for hydrogen production is summarized."

The reactors were constructed from commercially available or customized immersion well equipment combined with UV-transparent, solvent-resistant fluoropolymer (FEP) tubing. The reactors were assessed using the [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of malemide 1 and 1-hexyne forming the cyclobutene product 2 and the intramolecular [5 + 2] photocycloaddition of 3,4-dimethyl-1-pent-4-enylpyrrole-2,5-dione 3 to form the bicyclic azepine 4. The reactors were shown to be capable of producing >500 g of 2 and 175 g of 4 in a continuous 24 h processing period. Due to the facile control of irradiation time, the continuous flow reactor was also shown to be superior to a batch reactor for performing a problematic photochemical reaction on a larger scale."

The chiral (salen)Co−X complex (X = OAc, OTs, Cl) undergoes irreversible conversion to (salen)Co−OH during the course of the HKR and thus serves as both precatalyst and cocatalyst in a cooperative bimetallic catalytic mechanism. This insight led to the identification of more active catalysts for the HKR of synthetically useful terminal epoxides."

Unique carbon materials with differing hierarchical pore structures were synthesized from four types of zinc-containing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).

The recent discovery that certain transition metal carbonyls function as CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs) in biological systems highlighted the potential of exploiting this and similar classes of compounds as a stratagem to deliver CO for therapeutic purposes. Here we describe the biochemical features and pharmacological actions of a newly identified water-soluble CO releaser (CORM-A1) that, unlike the first prototypic molecule recently described (CORM-3), does not contain a transition metal and liberates CO at a much slower rate under physiological conditions. Using a myoglobin assay and an amperometric CO electrode, we demonstrated that the release of CO from CORM-A1 is both pH- and temperature-dependent with a half-life of approximately 21 min at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. In isolated aortic rings, CORM-A1 promoted a gradual but profound concentration-dependent vasorelaxation over time, which was highly amplified by YC-1 (1 microM) and attenuated by ODQ, a stimulator and inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, respectively. Similarly, administration of CORM-A1 (30 micromol/kg i.v.) in vivo produced a mild decrease in mean arterial pressure, which was markedly potentiated by pretreatment with YC-1 (1.2 micromol/kg i.v.). Interestingly, an inactive form of CORM-A1 that is incapable of releasing CO failed to promote both vasorelaxation and hypotension, thus directly implicating CO as the mediator of the observed pharmacological effects. Our results reveal that the bioactivities exerted by CORM-A1 reflect its intrinsic biochemical behavior of a slow CO releaser, which may be advantageous in the treatment of chronic conditions that require CO to be delivered in a carefully controlled manner."

Porous poly(arylene ethynylene) networks with surface areas up to 900 m2/g were produced. The surface chemistry of the networks was varied by monomer selection, thus allowing control over physical properties such as hydrophobicity. Additionally, it was shown that the dye sorption behavior of the networks can be controlled by varying the hydrophobicity. This expands significantly on the utility of this approach, allowing high surface area networks to be prepared with properties that can be tailored for applications such as catalysis and separations."

We conclude that yeast oils, the cheapest of the oils producible by heterotrophic microorganisms, are too expensive to be viable alternatives to the major commodity plant oils. Algal oils are similarly unlikely to be economic; the cheapest form of cultivation is in open ponds which then requires a robust, fast‐growing alga that can withstand adventitious predatory protozoa or contaminating bacteria and, at the same time, attain an oil content of at least 40% of the biomass. No such alga has yet been identified. However, we note that if the prices of the major plant oils and crude oil continue to rise in the future, as they have done over the past 12 months, then algal lipids might just become a realistic alternative within the next 10 to 15 years. Better prospects would, however, be to focus on algae as sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids."

We have sought to address this problem through the preparation and characterization of novel hybrid materials combining a catalytic MIP, capable of oxidizing the template, catechol, with an electrically conducting polymer. In this way a network of ""molecular wires"" assists in the conduction of electrons from the active sites within the MIP to the electrode surface. This was made possible by the design of a new monomer that combines orthogonal polymerizable functionality; comprising an aniline group and a methacrylamide. Conducting films were prepared on the surface of electrodes (Au on glass) by electropolymerization of the aniline moiety. A layer of MIP was photochemically grafted over the polyaniline, via N,N′-diethyldithiocarbamic acid benzyl ester (iniferter) activation of the methacrylamide groups. Detection of catechol by the hybrid-MIP sensor was found to be specific, and catechol oxidation was detected by cyclic voltammetry at the optimized operating conditions: potential range −0.6 V to +0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl), scan rate 50 mV/s, PBS pH 7.4. The calibration curve for catechol was found to be linear to 144 μM, with a limit of detection of 228 nM. Catechol and dopamine were detected by the sensor, whereas analogues and potentially interfering compounds, including phenol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, serotonin, and ascorbic acid, had minimal effect (≤3%) on the detection of either analyte. Non-imprinted hybrid electrodes and bare gold electrodes failed to give any response to catechol at concentrations below 0.5 mM. Finally, the catalytic properties of the sensor were characterized by chronoamperometry and were found to be consistent with Michaelis−Menten kinetics."

NPs have generated considerable interest in catalysis and electrocatalysis, where they provide a high surface area to mass ratio and can be tailored to promote particular reaction pathways. The activity of NPs can be analyzed especially well using electrochemistry, which probes interfacial chemistry directly. In this Review, we discuss key issues related to the electrochemistry of NPs. We highlight model studies that demonstrate exceptional control over the NP shape and size, or mass‐transport conditions, which can provide key insights into the behavior of ensembles of NPs. Particular focus is on the challenge of ultimately measuring reactions at individual NPs, and relating the response to their structure, which is leading to imaginative experiments that have an impact on electrochemistry in general as well as broader surface and colloid science."

The mechanisms by which thermal and catalytic treatments deconstruct lignin remain elusive, which is where quantum mechanical calculations can offer fundamental insights. Here, we compute homolytic bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) for four prevalent linkages in 69 lignin model compounds, including β-O-4, α-O-4, β-5, and biphenyl bonds, with a large range of natural and oxidized substituents. These calculations include ab initio benchmark values extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and full conformational searches for each compound. The results quantify both the relative BDEs among common lignin bonds and the effect of native and oxidized substituents on the functional groups in lignin. These data yield insights into thermal lignin deconstruction for a large range of prevalent linkages and aid in the identification of targets for catalytic cleavage."

As the toolbox of available biocatalysts continues to expand, so do the options for biocatalytic retrosynthesis of a target molecule, leading to alternative routes employing enzymatic transformations. The implementation of such cascade reactions requires careful consideration, particularly with respect to whether the pathway is constructed in vitro or in vivo. In this Perspective, we describe the relative merits of in vitro, in vivo, and hybrid approaches to building biocatalytic cascades and showcase recent developments in the area. We also highlight the factors that influence the design and implementation of purely enzymatic or chemoenzymatic, one-pot, multistep pathways."

However, an efficiency drop is often observed within the first few hundred hours of device operation, which could become an important issue. Here, we demonstrate that the electrode's metal migrating through the hole transporting material (HTM) layer and eventually contacting the perovskite is in part responsible for this early device degradation. We show that depositing the HTM within an insulating mesoporous ""buffer layer"" comprised of Al2O3 nanoparticles prevents the metal electrode migration while allowing for precise control of the HTM thickness. This enables an improvement in the solar cell fill factor and prevents degradation of the device after 350 h of operation."

New generations of metal chemotherapeutics offer the prospect of combating platinum resistance and expanding the range of treatable cancers. Such new complexes might be effective if they form distinctly different lesions on DNA. In this Forum Article, we discuss the possibility that targeting the redox balance in cancer cells may also be a highly effective strategy, especially because it is a multiple-site approach and offers selectivity over normal cells. Metal complexes can interfere in cellular redox chemistry in several ways: directly through metal or ligand redox centers or indirectly by binding to biomolecules involved in cellular redox pathways. We illustrate that a surprisingly large number of active metal anticancer agents have a potential redox arm to their mechanism of action. For such complexes, the possibility arises of using combination therapy together with redox modulators to increase the anticancer potency: attractive for lowering the doses of metal complexes that need to be administered. We illustrate that organometallic ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) arene complexes and iridium(III) cyclopentadienyl complexes of the type [(arene/Cp(xPh))M(N,N)Cl/I](n+) can achieve nanomolar potency toward cancer cells in combination with the redox modulator l-buthionine sulfoximine. Our discussion highlights the importance of determining not only the distribution of metal anticancer complexes in cells but also their speciation, the chemical form of the metal complex, including the oxidation state of the metal, the fate of the ligands, and dynamic processes such as efflux. This will be aided in the future by proteomic and genomic analyses but needs to be supplemented by new analytical methods that have the sensitivity and spatial and temporal resolution to reveal such information. To achieve this, major new funding programs are needed that support global research on the design of novel metal-based drugs with new mechanisms of action, tailored to patient needs."

Many of the well established methods for amide synthesis involve reagents that are difficult to handle and lead to the generation of large quantities of waste products. As a consequence, there has been a considerable amount of interest in the development of new approaches to amide synthesis. Over the past few years a wide range of new reagents and catalysts for direct amidation of carboxylic acids have been reported. In addition, the interconversion of amide derivatives through transamidation is emerging as a potential alternative strategy for accessing certain amides. This microreview covers recent developments in the direct amidation of carboxylic acids and the interconversion of amides through transamidation. The advantages and disadvantages of the various methods are discussed, as well as the possible mechanisms of the reactions."

However, there still lacks fundamental understanding of the role of the vacancies in semiconductor materials. Herein, the g-C3N4 nanosheets with tunable nitrogen vacancies are prepared as the photocatalysts for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction to CO. On the basis of both experimental investigation and DFT calculations, nitrogen vacancies in g-C3N4 induce the formation of midgap states under the conduction band edge. The position of midgap states becomes deeper with the increasing of nitrogen vacancies. The g-C3N4 nanosheets with the optimized density of nitrogen vacancies display about 18 times and 4 times enhancement for H2 evolution and of CO2 reduction to CO, respectively, as compared to the bulk g-C3N4. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of several factors including (1) nitrogen vacancies cause the excitation of electrons to midgap states below the conduction band edge, which results in extension of the visible light absorption to photons of longer wavelengths (up to 598 nm); (2) the suitable midgap states could trap photogenerated electrons to minimize the recombination loss of photogenerated electron–hole pairs; and (3) nitrogen vacancies lead to uniformly anchored small Pt nanoparticles (1–2 nm) on g-C3N4, and facilitate the electron transfer to Pt. However, the overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies generates deeper midgap states as the recombination centers, which results in deterioration of photocatalytic activities. Our work is expected to provide new insights for fabrication of nanomaterials with suitable vacancies for solar fuel generation."

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a process for flexible production of key chemicals from synthesis gas originating from non-petroleum-based sources. Although the use of iron-based catalysts would be preferred over the widely used cobalt, manufacturing methods that prevent their fast deactivation because of sintering, carbon deposition and phase changes have proven challenging. Here we present a strategy to produce highly dispersed iron carbides embedded in a matrix of porous carbon. Very high iron loadings (>40 wt %) are achieved while maintaining an optimal dispersion of the active iron carbide phase when a metal organic framework is used as catalyst precursor. The unique iron spatial confinement and the absence of large iron particles in the obtained solids minimize catalyst deactivation, resulting in high active and stable operation."

The idea of an entity that can repeatedly create more of itself has captured the imagination of many thinkers from von Neumann to Vonnegut. Beyond the sciences and science fiction, autocatalysis has found currency in economics and language theory, and has raised ethical fears memorably summed up by the “gray goo” trope. Autocatalysis is central to the propagation of life and intrinsic to many other biological processes. This includes the modern conception of evolution, which has radically altered humanity’s image of itself. Organisms can be thought of as imperfect self‐replicators which produce closely‐related species, allowing for selection and evolution. Hence, any consideration of self‐replication raises one of the most profound questions of all: what is life? Minimal self‐replicating systems have been studied with the aim of understanding the principles underlying living systems, allowing us to refine our concepts of biological fitness and chemical stability, self‐organization and emergence, and ultimately to discover how chemistry may become biology."

Ring opening polymerisation of cyclic esters is currently a topical field with metal complex-induced coordination/insertion type polymerisation leading the way. Such a polymerisation method offers a wide range of advantages from control over the polymer structure to kinetic enhancement; however industrially available catalysts based on tin suffer from inherent toxicity and as a result a policy change from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not unrealistic. This review underlines the efforts made in the past five years or so, and shows how low toxicity metals are attracting increasing attention in the field of ε-caprolactone polymerisation."

Their biosynthesis involves regioselective chlorination by flavin-dependent halogenases. We report the structural characterization of tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA), which regioselectively chlorinates tryptophan. Tryptophan and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are separated by a 10 angstrom-long tunnel and bound by distinct enzyme modules. The FAD module is conserved in halogenases and is related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. On the basis of biochemical studies, crystal structures, and by analogy with monooxygenases, we predict that FADH2 reacts with O2 to make peroxyflavin, which is decomposed by Cl-. The resulting HOCl is guided through the tunnel to tryptophan, where it is activated to participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution."

However, this is exactly the kind of scheme we propose for how Darwinian evolution could have occurred prior to template replication.We cannot confirm previous claims that autocatalytic sets of organic polymer molecules could undergo evolution in any interesting sense by themselves. While we and others have previously imagined inhibition would result in selectability, we found that it produced multiple attractors in an autocatalytic set that cannot be selected for. Instead, we discovered that if general conditions are satisfied, the accumulation of adaptations in chemical reaction networks can occur. These conditions are the existence of rare reactions producing viable cores (analogous to a genotype), that sustains a molecular periphery (analogous to a phenotype).We conclude that only when a chemical reaction network consists of many such viable cores, can it be evolvable. When many cores are enclosed in a compartment there is competition between cores within the same compartment, and when there are many compartments, there is between-compartment competition due to the phenotypic effects of cores and their periphery at the compartment level. Acquisition of cores by rare chemical events, and loss of cores at division, allows macromutation, limited heredity and selectability, thus explaining how a poor man's natural selection could have operated prior to genetic templates. This is the only demonstration to date of a mechanism by which pre-template accumulation of adaptation could occur."

However, current studies for nitrate electroreduction (NO 3 RR) mainly focus on metal‐based catalysts, which remains challenging because of the poor understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Herein, taking single transition metal atom supported on graphitic carbon nitrides (g‐CN) as an example, the NO 3 RR feasibility of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) is first demonstrated by using density functional theory calculations. The results reveal that highly efficient NO 3 RR toward NH 3 can be achieved on Ti/g‐CN and Zr/g‐CN with low limiting potentials of −0.39 and −0.41 V, respectively. Furthermore, the considerable energy barriers are observed during the formation of byproducts NO 2 , NO, N 2 O, and N 2 on Ti/g‐CN and Zr/g‐CN, guaranteeing their high selectivity. This work provides a new route for the application of SACs and paves the way to the development of NO 3 RR."

Lignin depolymerization, however, is not as well understood, primarily due to the heterogeneity and reactivity of lignin. We present an experimental and theoretical study of acid-catalyzed cleavage of two non-phenolic and two phenolic dimers that exhibit the β-O-4 ether linkage, the most common intermonomer bond in lignin. This work demonstrates that the rate of acid-catalyzed β-O-4 cleavage in dimers exhibiting a phenolic hydroxyl group is 2 orders of magnitude faster than in non-phenolic dimers. The experiments suggest that the major product distribution is similar for all model compounds, but a stable phenyl-dihydrobenzofuran species is observed in the acidolysis of two of the γ-carbinol containing model compounds. The presence of a methoxy substituent, commonly found in native lignin, prevents the formation of this intermediate. Reaction pathways were examined with quantum mechanical calculations, which aid in explaining the substantial differences in reactivity. Moreover, we use a radical scavenger to show that the commonly proposed homolytic cleavage pathway of phenolic β-O-4 linkages is unlikely in acidolysis conditions. Overall, this study explains the disparity between rates of β-O-4 cleavage seen in model compound experiments and acid pretreatment of biomass, and implies that depolymerization of lignin during acid-catalyzed pretreatment or fractionation will proceed via a heterolytic, unzipping mechanism wherein β-O-4 linkages are cleaved from the phenolic ends of branched, polymer chains inward toward the core of the polymer."

Here, we integrate robotic experimentation with high-throughput computation to navigate the available structure–property space. A total of 6354 co-polymers was considered computationally, followed by the synthesis and photocatalytic characterization of a sub-library of more than 170 co-polymers. This led to the discovery of new polymers with sacrificial hydrogen evolution rates (HERs) of more than 6 mmol g–1 h–1. The variation in HER across the library does not correlate strongly with any single physical property, but a machine-learning model involving four separate properties can successfully describe up to 68% of the variation in the HER data between the different polymers. The four variables used in the model were the predicted electron affinity, the predicted ionization potential, the optical gap, and the dispersibility of the polymer particles in solution, as measured by optical transmittance."

Both probes are commercially available at reasonable cost and can be used with standard UV-vis spectrometers. Although DPBF is not soluble in neat water and is not specific to the detection of 1O2, it has very high, essentially diffusion-limited, reactivity towards 1O2; it can trap up to 50% of all 1O2 created in alcohol/water or micellar solution, and even more when replacing H2O by D2O, which makes it highly useful when the process under investigation does not yield much 1O2. On the other hand, ABDA has a much lower reactivity, reacting with only 2% of the singlet oxygen generated in H2O, as well as a smaller extinction coefficient, resulting in a much smaller spectroscopic response, but is soluble in neat water and is specific for 1O2, allowing for discrimination from other reactive oxygen species. The results presented here not only allow a comparative assessment of the usefulness of the two 1O2 probes, but also provide a reference for an accurate absolute quantification of the amount of 1O2 generated in an experiment from the observed absorbance bleach."

Dye‐sensitized and perovskite solar cells employing Al‐doped TiO 2 have increased device efficiencies and significantly enhanced operational device stability in inert atmospheres.

Theory and experiment show that while the Ir 4f line shape of Ir metal is well described by a simple Doniach–Šunjić function, the peculiar line shape of rutile‐type IrO 2 requires the addition of a shake‐up satellite 1 eV above the main line. In the catalytically more active amorphous IrO x , we find that additional intensity appears in the Ir 4f spectrum at higher binding energy when compared with rutile‐type IrO 2 along with a pre‐edge feature in the O K‐edge. We identify these additional features as electronic defects in the anionic and cationic frameworks, namely, formally O I− and Ir III , which may explain the increased activity of amorphous IrO x electrocatalysts.

This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions demands that stabilizing the atmospheric CO(2) levels to just twice their pre-anthropogenic values by mid-century will be extremely challenging, requiring invention, development and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable and exploitable energy resources, nuclear fusion energy or solar energy are by far the largest. However, in both cases, technological breakthroughs are required with nuclear fusion being very difficult, if not impossible on the scale required. On the other hand, 1 h of sunlight falling on our planet is equivalent to all the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. If solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, then it must be stored and despatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar energy in the form of chemical bonds as occurs in natural photosynthesis. However, a technology is needed which has a year-round average conversion efficiency significantly higher than currently available by natural photosynthesis so as to reduce land-area requirements and to be independent of food production. Therefore, the scientific challenge is to construct an 'artificial leaf' able to efficiently capture and convert solar energy and then store it in the form of chemical bonds of a high-energy density fuel such as hydrogen while at the same time producing oxygen from water. Realistically, the efficiency target for such a technology must be 10 per cent or better. Here, we review the molecular details of the energy capturing reactions of natural photosynthesis, particularly the water-splitting reaction of photosystem II and the hydrogen-generating reaction of hydrogenases. We then follow on to describe how these two reactions are being mimicked in physico-chemical-based catalytic or electrocatalytic systems with the challenge of creating a large-scale robust and efficient artificial leaf technology."

In this study, the catalytic pyrolysis of different types of plastics waste (PS, PE, PP, and PET) as single or mixed in different ratios in the presence of modified natural zeolite (NZ) catalysts in a small pilot scale pyrolysis reactor was carried out. The NZ was modified by thermal activation (TA-NZ) at 550°C and acid activation (AA-NZ) with HNO3 to enhance its catalytic properties. The catalytic pyrolysis of PS produced the highest liquid oil (70 and 60%) than PP (40 and 54%) and PE (40 and 42%) using TA-NZ and AA-NZ catalysts respectively. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of oil showed a mixture of aromatics, aliphatic and other hydrocarbon compounds. The TA-NZ and AA-NZ catalysts showed a different effect on the wt.% of catalytic pyrolysis products and liquid oil chemical composition, with AA-NZ showing higher catalytic activity than TA-NZ. FT-IR results showed clear peaks of aromatic compounds in all liquid oil samples with some peaks of alkanes that further confirmed the GC-MS results. The liquid oil has higher heating values (HHV) range of 41.7-44.2 MJ/kg, close to conventional diesel. Therefore, it has the potential to be used as an alternative source of energy and as transportation fuel after refining/ blending with conventional fuels."

Until recently, most organometallic reagents that facilitate this process have combined strongly electropositive metals, such as lithium, with organic reagents to form highly polar and, by implication, highly reactive carbon-metal bonds. For example, the alkyllithium reagents and bulky lithium amides that are commonly employed for this purpose can suffer from low functional group tolerance. Lithio-products of these reactions generally have low kinetic stabilities. More recently, several groups around the world have pioneered alternative metalation reagents, complex metalators, which can be interpreted as composite molecules or mixtures made up of two or more distinct compound types. Several examples include magnesiate complexes, Lochmann-Schlosser superbases, Kondo and Uchiyama's 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (TMP)-zincate complexes, and Knochel's turbo-Grignard and related salt-supported reagents. This Account describes our rational development of novel complex metalators based on existing structural templates and designed to execute alkali-metal-mediated metalations (AMMMs). By changing the nonalkali metal in these structures, we have produced tailor-made dianionic-dicationic structures such as [(TMEDA).Na(mu-TMP)(mu-(n)Bu)Mg(TMP)], [(TMEDA).Na(mu-TMP)(mu-(t)Bu)Zn((t)Bu)], and [(TMEDA).Li(mu-TMP)Mn(CH(2)SiMe(3))(2)] (TMEDA = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine). These compounds can perform unprecedented magnesiations, zincations, or manganations on aromatic substrates that are generally inert toward conventional Mg, Zn, or Mn(II) reagents. Although the alkali metal is an essential component of these new complex metalators, interestingly, the less electropositive, less polar nonalkali metal [Mg, Zn, or Mn(II)] actually carries out the deprotonation. We view this unique behavior as a mixed-metal synergic effect: intramolecular communication through metal-ligand-metal bridges directs special regioselectivities or polydeprotonations. We demonstrate structurally defined alkali-metal-mediated magnesiations (AMMMg), zincations (AMMZn), and manganations [AMMMn(II)] of representative aromatic substrates (including benzene, toluene, anisole, and ferrocene). In addition, we present remarkable meta-orientated metalations of toluene and N,N-dimethylaniline. We also review 2-fold metalations of arenes, in which an arenediide guest is encapsulated within a 12-atom polymetallic cationic (NaNNaNMgN)(2) host ring to form inverse crown structures. Furthermore, using X-ray crystallography of a turbo-Grignard reagent, we establish a link between our complex metalators and turbo-Grignard reagents. Armed with this accruing knowledge of complex metalators, we think rapid progress in ""low polarity metalation"" should now be possible. The greatest remaining challenge is to develop methodologies that shift these processes from stoichiometric reactions into more economical catalytic ones."

However, when prepared in nanocrystalline form, as a collection of a few hundreds of atoms, it displays remarkable activity as a heterogeneous catalyst for a broad range of redox reactions. Of particular note is the ability of gold, either alone or alloyed with palladium, to catalyse selective oxidation reactions, e.g. alkene epoxidation, alcohol oxidation, and the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by the hydrogenation of molecular oxygen. In this article the recent advances in this exciting new field are explored."

Based on a highly conductive WC backbone, nanosized Mo 2 C particles are integrated onto WC, forming a well‐defined and highly robust nanowire structure. More importantly, it is found that electrochemical activation can partially remove surface carbon and activate the catalyst by changing its surface hydrophilicity. As a result, the residual carbon contributes positively to the activity, besides its role of protecting carbide from oxidation. Benefiting from the structure, the catalyst achieves high activity, stable electrolysis towards HER."

In this Account, we summarize the strategies for making a variety of self-supported noble metal aerogels consisting of extended metal backbone nanonetworks. We discuss their outstanding physical and chemical properties, including their three-dimensional network structure, the simple control over their composition, their large specific surface area, and their hierarchical porosity. Additionally, we show some initial results on their excellent performance as electrocatalysts combining both high catalytic activity and high durability for fuel cell reactions such as ethanol oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finally, we give some hints on the future challenges in the research area of metal aerogels. We believe that metal aerogels are a new, promising class of electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and will also open great opportunities for other electrochemical energy systems, catalysis, and sensors. The commercialization of PEFCs encounters three critical obstacles, viz., high cost, insufficient activity, and inadequate long-term durability. Besides others, the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and alcohol oxidation and insufficient catalyst stability are important reasons for these obstacles. Various approaches have been taken to overcome these obstacles, e.g., by controlling the catalyst particle size in an optimized range, forming multimetallic catalysts, controlling the surface compositions, shaping the catalysts into nanocrystals, and designing supportless catalysts with extended surfaces such as nanostructured thin films, nanotubes, and porous nanostructures. These efforts have produced plenty of excellent electrocatalysts, but the development of multisynergetic functional catalysts exhibiting low cost, high activity, and high durability still faces great challenges. In this Account, we demonstrate that the sol-gel process represents a powerful ""bottom-up"" strategy for creating nanostructured materials that tackles the problems mentioned above. Aerogels are unique solid materials with ultralow densities, large open pores, and ultimately high inner surface areas. They magnify the specific properties of nanomaterials to the macroscale via self-assembly, which endow them with superior properties. Despite numerous investigations of metal oxide aerogels, the investigation of metal aerogels is in the early stage. Recently, aerogels including Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, and Cu have been obtained by nanosmelting of hybrid polymer-metal oxide aerogels. We report here exclusively on mono-, bi- and multimetallic noble metal aerogels consisting of Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd and their application as electrocatalysts."

In this work, the toxicity of these ILs toward enzymes and bacteria was assessed, and the effect of the anion on these properties is discussed. The inhibitory potentials of this type of ILs to acetylcholinesterase were weaker approximately an order of magnitude than the traditional IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. Additionally, the [Ch][AA] ILs displayed low toxicity toward the bacteria tested. Furthermore, the biodegradability of the [Ch][AA] ILs was evaluated via the closed bottle and CO2 headspace tests using wastewater microorganisms. All the ILs were classified as 'readily biodegradable' based on their high levels of mineralization (62-87%). The presence of extra carboxyl or amide groups on the amino acid side chain rendered the ILs significantly more susceptible to microbial breakdown. In addition, for most of the [Ch][AA] ILs, low toxicity correlated with good biodegradability. The low toxicity and high biodegradability of these novel [Ch][AA] make them promising candidates for use as environmentally friendly solvents in large-scale applications."

In recent years, the renewable synthesis of aliphatic hydrocarbons has been made possible by engineering microbes to overaccumulate fatty acids. However, to generate end products with the desired physicochemical properties (e.g., fatty aldehydes, alkanes, and alcohols), further conversion of the fatty acid is necessary. A carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) from Mycobacterium marinum was found to convert a wide range of aliphatic fatty acids (C 6 –C 18 ) into corresponding aldehydes. Together with the broad-substrate specificity of an aldehyde reductase or an aldehyde decarbonylase, the catalytic conversion of fatty acids to fatty alcohols (C 8 –C 16 ) or fatty alkanes (C 7 –C 15 ) was reconstituted in vitro. This concept was applied in vivo , in combination with a chain-length-specific thioesterase, to engineer Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strains that were capable of synthesizing fatty alcohols and alkanes. A fatty alcohol titer exceeding 350 mg·L −1 was obtained in minimal media supplemented with glucose. Moreover, by combining the CAR-dependent pathway with an exogenous fatty acid-generating lipase, natural oils (coconut oil, palm oil, and algal oil bodies) were enzymatically converted into fatty alcohols across a broad chain-length range (C 8 –C 18 ). Together with complementing enzymes, the broad substrate specificity and kinetic characteristics of CAR opens the road for direct and tailored enzyme-catalyzed conversion of lipids into user-ready chemical commodities."

Here, we show that enzymes can also be extremely efficient electrocatalysts (catalysts of redox reactions at electrodes). Despite being large and electronically insulating through most of their volume, some enzymes, when attached to an electrode, catalyze electrochemical reactions that are otherwise extremely sluggish (even with the best synthetic catalysts) and require a large overpotential to achieve a useful rate. These enzymes produce high electrocatalytic currents, displayed in single bidirectional voltammetric waves that switch direction (between oxidation and reduction) sharply at the equilibrium potential for the substrate redox couple. Notoriously irreversible processes such as CO(2) reduction are thereby rendered electrochemically reversible--a consequence of molecular evolution responding to stringent biological drivers for thermodynamic efficiency. Enzymes thus set high standards for the catalysts of future energy technologies."

As liquids composed solely of ions, the scientific consensus has been that ionic liquids have exceedingly high ionic strengths and thus very short Debye screening lengths. However, several recent experiments from laboratories around the world have reported data for the approach of two surfaces separated by ionic liquids which revealed remarkable long range forces that appear to be electrostatic in origin. Evidence has accumulated demonstrating long range surface forces for several different combinations of ionic liquids and electrically charged surfaces, as well as for concentrated mixtures of inorganic salts in solvent. The original interpretation of these forces, that ionic liquids could be envisioned as ""dilute electrolytes,"" was controversial, and the origin of long range forces in ionic liquids remains the subject of discussion. Here we seek to collate and examine the evidence for long range surface forces in ionic liquids, identify key outstanding questions, and explore possible mechanisms underlying the origin of these long range forces. Long range surface forces in ionic liquids and other highly concentrated electrolytes hold diverse implications from designing ionic liquids for energy storage applications to rationalizing electrostatic correlations in biological self-assembly."

The adsorption and desorption kinetics are dependent on the specific properties of the drugs and the morphology of the HA nanoparticles. Adsorption of the platinum complexes occurs with retention of the nitrogen ligands but the chloride ligands of cisplatin are displaced. Despite their opposite charges, the negatively charged alendronate bisphosphonate and the positively charged aquated cisplatin are strongly adsorbed, while the neutral DPM complex shows lower affinity towards the negatively charged apatitic surface. The data suggest that adsorption of the two platinum complexes is driven by electrostatic attractions, while interaction between the alendronate and the HA surface takes place by ligand exchange in which the two phosphonate groups of the drug molecule replace two surface phosphate groups. Significantly, adsorption of positively charged hydrolysis species of cisplatin is more favored on the phosphate‐rich HAns surface while adsorption of negatively charged alendronate is more favored on the calcium‐rich HAps surface. The latter type of short‐range electrostatic interactions also appear to dominate the desorption kinetics; consequently, drug release is greater for neutral DPM than for charged alendronate and aquated cisplatin. Moreover, while the release per unit area of charged species is the same for the two types of HAs, the release of DPM is faster from HAns, which is lower in surface calcium, than for HAps. Overall, this work demonstrates that the properties of HA nanocrystals can be modulated in such a way to produce HA/biomolecule conjugates tailored for specific therapeutic applications."

These properties are achieved by the in‐situ generation of oxygen through the thermal decomposition of peroxo‐titania complex (formed by the precursor modification with H 2 O 2 ). Titania containing the highest amount of oxygen (16 H 2 O 2 ‐TiO 2 ) retains 100% anatase phase even at 900 °C, where as the control sample exists as 100% rutile at this temperature. The same composition exhibits a six‐fold and two‐fold increase in visible light photocatalytic activities in comparison to the control sample and the standard photocatalyst Degussa P‐25 respectively. Among the various para­meters affecting the photocatalytic action, such as band gap narrowing, textural properties, crystallite size, and anatase phase stability, band gap narrowing was identified as the major factor responsible for the visible light photocatalytic activity. Increased Ti–O–Ti bond strength and upward shifting of the valence band (VB) maximum, which is responsible for the high temperature stability and visible light activity respectively, are identified from FT–IR, XPS, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic studies. It is therefore proposed that the oxygen excess defects present in these titania samples are responsible for the high temperature stability and enhanced visible light photocatalytic activities."

Accessing meta-functionalized phenols from the parent phenols, on the other hand, generally requires lengthy synthetic sequences. Here, we report the first methodology for the one-pot direct meta-selective arylation of phenols. This methodology is based on a traceless directing group relay strategy. In this process carbon dioxide is used as a transient directing group which facilitates a palladium catalyzed arylation meta to the phenol hydroxyl group with iodoarenes. This transformation proceeds with complete meta-selectivity and is compatible with a variety of functional groups both in the phenol and in the iodoarene coupling partner."

The emerging concepts of alkali-metal-mediated magnesiation and alkali-metal-mediated zincation are introduced with respect to the selective deprotonation and/or polydeprotonation of a series of arene, aromatic heterocyclic, metallocene, and metal π-arene substrates. It is shown that, in accomplishing such deprotonations, alkali metal−magnesium amide based reagents can often generate ""inverse crown"" ring compounds. Inverse crowns display polymetallic cationic ""host"" rings (residue of the reacted mixed-metal base) surrounding an anionic ""guest"" (the deprotonated substrate) in a Lewis acidic−Lewis basic arrangement inverse to that encountered in conventional crown ether complexes. A signature feature of inverse crown ring and related mixed-metal structures is a synergic combination of Mg−C (or Zn−C) σ bonds and alkali-metal−π contacts. Also included are related inverse crown ether complexes in which the guest can be an oxo, peroxo, hydrido, alkoxo, or enolato anion and the first example of the concept of synergic nucleophilic addition involving the action of a new sodium dialkylamidozincate reagent toward benzophenone."

Relay resonators are spaced between the transmitter and receiver coils with the objectives of maximizing energy efficiency and increasing the overall transmission distance between the power source and the load. Analytical expressions for the optimal load and maximum efficiency at resonance frequency are derived. These equations are verified with practical measurements obtained from both coaxial and noncoaxial domino resonator systems. To avoid the use of high operating frequency for wireless power transfer in previous related research, the technique presented here can be used at submegahertz operation so as to minimize the power loss in both the power supply and the output stage. We demonstrated both theoretically and practically that unequal spacing for the coaxial straight domino systems has better efficiency performance than the equal-spacing method. Also, the flexibility of using resonators in various domino forms is demonstrated."

Subsequent modification of these Co3O4/TiO2 composites by trace amounts of graphene oxide nanosheets in the presence of a diamine linker further promotes both oxytetracycline and Congo Red photodegradation under simulated solar and visible irradiation, through a combination of enhanced photoresponse and consequent radical generation.

They also offer opportunities for the design of new drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Here we focus on anticancer drugs which might complement successful platinum drugs in the clinic by widening the spectrum of activity, reducing side-effects and combatting resistance. The early clinical trials of titanocene dichloride highlighted the need to understand the aqueous solution chemistry of organometallic complexes and to identify their target sites in cancer cells. More recently organometallic Cp complexes of Fe(II), Rh(III) and Ir(III), and arene complexes of Ru(II) and Os(II), have been shown to target the redox balance in cancer cells, in contrast to DNA which is the target of cisplatin and related platinum drugs. The activity of both catalytic and photoactive organometallic compounds is being explored. Target recognition and activity are highly dependent not only on the metal and its oxidation state, but also the other coordinated ligands, the coordination number and geometry. In general, organometallic complexes are 'pro-drugs' which undergo activation in vivo (by ligand exchange or redox reactions), and the ligands themselves may be active components of the drug. A major challenge is to elucidate the chemistry of organometallic complexes directly in cells. The design of organometallic complexes for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in cancer and other areas of medicine present new and exciting research opportunities."

In this review, principles and mechanisms of DAAFCs in alcohol oxidation and oxygen reduction are discussed. Despite the high energy densities available during the oxidation of polycarbon alcohols they are difficult to oxidise. Apart from methanol, the complete oxidation of other polycarbon alcohols to CO2 has not been achieved with current catalysts. Different types of catalysts, from conventional precious metal catalyst of Pt and Pt alloys to other lower cost Pd, Au and Ag metal catalysts are compared. Non precious metal catalysts, and lanthanum, strontium oxides and perovskite-type oxides are also discussed. Membranes like the ones used as polymer electrolytes and developed for DAAFCs are reviewed. Unlike conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells, anion exchange membranes are used in present DAAFCs. Fuel cell performance with DAAFCs using different alcohols, catalysts and membranes, as well as operating parameters are summarised. In order to improve the power output of the DAAFCs, further developments in catalysts, membrane materials and fuel cell systems are essential."

To address this, we developed a serum-stable, nanoparticle catalyst-labeled LFIA with a sensitivity surpassing that of both current commercial and published sensitivities for paper-based detection of p24, one of the earliest and most conserved biomarkers of HIV. We report the synthesis and characterization of porous platinum core–shell nanocatalysts (PtNCs), which show high catalytic activity when exposed to complex human blood serum samples. We explored the application of antibody-functionalized PtNCs with strategically and orthogonally modified nanobodies with high affinity and specificity toward p24 and established the key larger nanoparticle size regimes needed for efficient amplification and performance in LFIA. Harnessing the catalytic amplification of PtNCs enabled naked-eye detection of p24 spiked into sera in the low femtomolar range (ca. 0.8 pg·mL–1) and the detection of acute-phase HIV in clinical human plasma samples in under 20 min. This provides a versatile absorbance-based and rapid LFIA with sensitivity capable of significantly reducing the HIV acute phase detection window. This diagnostic may be readily adapted for detection of other biomolecules as an ultrasensitive screening tool for infectious and noncommunicable diseases and can be capitalized upon in PoC settings for early disease detection."

In comparison with near‐global satellite observations from the MOPITT instrument and local surface measurements, the models show large underestimates of Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical CO, while typically performing reasonably well elsewhere. The results suggest that year‐round emissions, probably from fossil fuel burning in east Asia and seasonal biomass burning emissions in south‐central Africa, are greatly underestimated in current inventories such as IIASA and EDGAR3.2. Variability among models is large, likely resulting primarily from intermodel differences in representations and emissions of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and in hydrologic cycles, which affect OH and soluble hydrocarbon intermediates. Global mean projections of the 2030 CO response to emissions changes are quite robust. Global mean midtropospheric (500 hPa) CO increases by 12.6 ± 3.5 ppbv (16%) for the high‐emissions (A2) scenario, by 1.7 ± 1.8 ppbv (2%) for the midrange (CLE) scenario, and decreases by 8.1 ± 2.3 ppbv (11%) for the low‐emissions (MFR) scenario. Projected 2030 climate changes decrease global 500 hPa CO by 1.4 ± 1.4 ppbv. Local changes can be much larger. In response to climate change, substantial effects are seen in the tropics, but intermodel variability is quite large. The regional CO responses to emissions changes are robust across models, however. These range from decreases of 10–20 ppbv over much of the industrialized NH for the CLE scenario to CO increases worldwide and year‐round under A2, with the largest changes over central Africa (20–30 ppbv), southern Brazil (20–35 ppbv) and south and east Asia (30–70 ppbv). The trajectory of future emissions thus has the potential to profoundly affect air quality over most of the world's populated areas."

It is also one of the most commercially used form. To date, no parameter has been set for the average ambient air concentration of TiO 2 nanoparticles (NP) by any regulatory agency. Previously conducted studies had established these nanoparticles to be mainly non-cyto- and -genotoxic, although they had been found to generate free radicals both acellularly (specially through photocatalytic activity) and intracellularly. The present study determines the role of TiO 2 -NP (anatase, ∅ &lt; 100 nm) using several parameters such as cyto- and genotoxicity, DNA-adduct formation and generation of free radicals following its uptake by human lung cells in vitro . For comparison, iron containing nanoparticles (hematite, Fe 2 O 3 , ∅ &lt; 100 nm) were used. The results of this study showed that both types of NP were located in the cytosol near the nucleus. No particles were found inside the nucleus, in mitochondria or ribosomes. Human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) were more sensitive regarding cyto- and genotoxic effects caused by the NP than human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). In contrast to hematite NP, TiO 2 -NP did not induce DNA-breakage measured by the Comet-assay in both cell types. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured acellularly (without any photocatalytic activity) as well as intracellularly for both types of particles, however, the iron-containing NP needed special reducing conditions before pronounced radical generation. A high level of DNA adduct formation (8-OHdG) was observed in IMR-90 cells exposed to TiO 2 -NP, but not in cells exposed to hematite NP. Our study demonstrates different modes of action for TiO 2 - and Fe 2 O 3 -NP. Whereas TiO 2 -NP were able to generate elevated amounts of free radicals, which induced indirect genotoxicity mainly by DNA-adduct formation, Fe 2 O 3 -NP were clastogenic (induction of DNA-breakage) and required reducing conditions for radical formation."

This challenge is highlighted by the estimate that 40-45% of drug candidates contain a chiral amine, fueling a demand for broadly applicable synthetic methods that deliver target structures in high yield and enantiomeric excess. Herein we describe the development and application of a ""toolbox"" of monoamine oxidase variants from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N) which display remarkable substrate scope and tolerance for sterically demanding motifs, including a new variant, which exhibits high activity and enantioselectivity toward substrates containing the aminodiphenylmethane (benzhydrylamine) template. By combining rational structure-guided engineering with high-throughput screening, it has been possible to expand the substrate scope of MAO-N to accommodate amine substrates containing bulky aryl substituents. These engineered MAO-N biocatalysts have been applied in deracemization reactions for the efficient asymmetric synthesis of the generic active pharmaceutical ingredients Solifenacin and Levocetirizine as well as the natural products (R)-coniine, (R)-eleagnine, and (R)-leptaflorine.

Variable temperature resistivity studies reveal a transition from a semiconducting to a metallic phase with decreasing temperature, which is unprecedented in MOFs. We find this transition to be highly dependent on the film thickness and the amount of solvent trapped in the pores, with density functional theory calculations of the electronic-structure supporting the complex metallic conductivity of the material.

Design of a catalyst by managing catalytic sites on an atomic scale is significant for tuning catalytic performance and offering high activity and selectivity at a relatively low temperature. Here, we report a synergy effect of two sets of single-atom sites (Ni1 and Ru1) anchored on the surface of a CeO2 nanorod, Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2. The surface of this catalyst, Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2, consists of two sets of single-atom sites which are highly active for reforming CH4 using CO2 with a turnover rate of producing 73.6 H2 molecules on each site per second at 560 °C. Selectivity for producing H2 at this temperature is 98.5%. The single-atom sites Ni1 and Ru1 anchored on the CeO2 surface of Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2 remain singly dispersed and in a cationic state during catalysis up to 600 °C. The two sets of single-atom sites play a synergistic role, evidenced by lower apparent activation barrier and higher turnover rate for production of H2 and CO on Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2 in contrast to Ce0.95Ni0.05O2 with only Ni1 single-atom sites and Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 with only Ru1 single-atom sites. Computational studies suggest a molecular mechanism for the observed synergy effects, which originate at (1) the different roles of Ni1 and Ru1 sites in terms of activations of CH4 to form CO on a Ni1 site and dissociation of CO2 to CO on a Ru1 site, respectively and (2) the sequential role in terms of first forming H atoms through activation of CH4 on a Ni1 site and then coupling of H atoms to form H2 on a Ru1 site. These synergistic effects of the two sets of single-atom sites on the same surface demonstrated a new method for designing a catalyst with high activity and selectivity at a relatively low temperature."

For glassy polymers, the gas transport properties depend on the amount and distribution of free volume and on chain mobility. The most highly permeable polymers have rigid, twisted macromolecular backbones that give rise to microvoids. Examples include substituted polyacetylenes, perfluoropolymers, addition-type polynorbornene, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) and some polyimides. High permeability membranes may also be produced by thermal rearrangement of precursor polymers."

The scope and limitations of these methods were investigated with attention paid to side reactions, scale, and aqueous- and bio-compatibility.

Chemists will be challenged to develop new, efficient synthetic processes that have the fewest possible steps leading to a target molecule, the goal being to decrease the amount of waste generated and reduce energy use. Along this path, chemists will need to develop highly selective reactions with atom-economical pathways producing nontoxic byproduct. In this context, C-H bond activation and functionalization is an extremely attractive method. Indeed, for most organic transformations, the presence of a reactive functionality is required. In Total Synthesis, the ""protection and deprotection"" approach with such reactive groups limits the overall yield of the synthesis, involves the generation of significant chemical waste, costs energy, and in the end is not as green as one would hope. In turn, if a C-H bond functionalization were possible, instead of the use of a prefunctionalized version of the said C-H bond, the number of steps in a synthesis would obviously be reduced. In this case, the C-H bond can be viewed as a dormant functional group that can be activated when necessary during the synthetic strategy. One issue increasing the challenge of such a desired reaction is selectivity. The cleavage of a C-H bond (bond dissociation requires between 85 and 105 kcal/mol) necessitates a high-energy species, which could quickly become a drawback for the control of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity. Transition metal catalysts are useful reagents for surmounting this problem; they can decrease the kinetic barrier of the reaction yet retain control over selectivity. Transition metal complexes also offer important versatility in having distinct pathways that can lead to activation of the C-H bond. An oxidative addition of the metal in the C-H bond, and a base-assisted metal-carbon bond formation in which the base can be coordinated (or not) to the metal complexes are possible. These different C-H bond activation modes provide chemists with several synthetic options. In this Account, we discuss recent discoveries involving the versatile NHC-gold(I) and NHC-copper(I) hydroxide complexes (where NHC is N-heterocyclic carbene) showing interesting Brønsted basic properties for C-H bond activation or C-H bond functionalization purposes. The simple and easy synthesis of these two complexes involves their halide-bearing relatives reacting with simple alkali metal hydroxides. These complexes can react cleanly with organic compounds bearing protons with compatible pK(a) values, producing only water as byproduct. It is a very simple protocol indeed and may be sold as a C-H bond activation, although the less flashy ""metalation reaction"" also accurately describes the process. The synthesis of these complexes has led us to develop new organometallic chemistry and catalysis involving C-H bond activation (metalation) and subsequent C-H bond functionalization. We further highlight applications with these reactions, in areas such as photoluminescence and biological activities of NHC-gold(I) and NHC-copper(I) complexes."

Herein, we present a CuCo bimetallic catalyst able to imitate the bifunctional nature of copper-type nitrite reductase, which could easily remove NO 2 − via the collaboration of two active centers. Indeed, Co acts as an electron/proton donating center, while Cu facilitates NO x − adsorption/association.

A mechanistic study, using electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy, reveals a strong synergy between Cu and Co, with Co sites promoting the hydrogenation of NO 3 − to NH 3 via adsorbed *H species. The well-modulated coverage of adsorbed *H and *NO 3 led simultaneously to high NH 3 selectivity and yield."

Carbon monoxide (CO), one of the products of the cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in cancer cells, has been implicated in carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance. However, the functional contributions of CO and HO-1 to these processes are poorly defined. In human prostate cancers, we found that HO-1 was nuclear localized in malignant cells, with low enzymatic activity in moderately differentiated tumors correlating with relatively worse clinical outcomes. Exposure to CO sensitized prostate cancer cells but not normal cells to chemotherapy, with growth arrest and apoptosis induced in vivo in part through mitotic catastrophe. CO targeted mitochondria activity in cancer cells as evidenced by higher oxygen consumption, free radical generation, and mitochondrial collapse. Collectively, our findings indicated that CO transiently induces an anti-Warburg effect by rapidly fueling cancer cell bioenergetics, ultimately resulting in metabolic exhaustion."

Since then, an enormous amount of work has been undertaken to investigate and develop effective catalysts for this process. Although the catalytic synthesis of ammonia has been extensively studied in the last century, many new catalysts are still currently being developed to reduce the operating temperature and pressure of the process and to improve the conversion of reactants to ammonia. New catalysts for the Haber–Bosch process are the key to achieving green ammonia production in the foreseeable future. Herein, the history of ammonia synthesis catalyst development is briefly described as well as recent progress in catalyst development with the aim of building an overview of the current state of ammonia synthesis catalysts for the Haber–Bosch process. The new emerging ammonia synthesis catalysts, including electride, hydride, amide, perovskite oxide hydride/oxynitride hydride, nitride, and oxide promoted metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni, are promising alternatives to the conventional fused‐Fe and promoted‐Ru catalysts for existing ammonia synthesis plants and future distributed green ammonia synthesis based on the Haber–Bosch process."

This is a leading cause of adverse drug reactions, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic window or cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. To address these problems, there are various functional biocompatible drug carriers available in the market, which can deliver therapeutic agents to the target site in a controlled manner. Among the carriers developed thus far, mesoporous materials emerged as a promising candidate that can deliver a variety of drug molecules in a controllable and sustainable manner. In particular, mesoporous silica nanoparticles are widely used as a delivery reagent because silica possesses favourable chemical properties, thermal stability and biocompatibility. Currently, sol-gel-derived mesoporous silica nanoparticles in soft conditions are of main interest due to simplicity in production and modification and the capacity to maintain function of bioactive agents. The unique mesoporous structure of silica facilitates effective loading of drugs and their subsequent controlled release. The properties of mesopores, including pore size and porosity as well as the surface properties, can be altered depending on additives used to fabricate mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Active surface enables functionalisation to modify surface properties and link therapeutic molecules. The tuneable mesopore structure and modifiable surface of mesoporous silica nanoparticle allow incorporation of various classes of drug molecules and controlled delivery to the target sites. This review aims to present the state of knowledge of currently available drug delivery system and identify properties of an ideal drug carrier for specific application, focusing on mesoporous silica nanoparticles."

Here we show that tethering molecular catalysts-a rhenium complex, [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl]-together in the form of a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) affords a heterogeneous photocatalyst with a strong visible light absorption, a high CO2 binding affinity, and ultimately an improved catalytic performance over its homogeneous Re counterpart. The COF incorporates bipyridine sites, allowing for ligation of the Re complex, into a fully π-conjugated backbone that is chemically robust and promotes light-harvesting. A maximum rate of 1040 μmol g-1 h-1 for CO production with 81% selectivity was measured. CO production rates were further increased up to 1400 μmol g-1 h-1, with an improved selectivity of 86%, when a photosensitizer was added. Addition of platinum resulted in production of syngas, hence, the co-formation of H2 and CO, the chemical composition of which could be adjusted by varying the ratio of COF to platinum. An amorphous analog of the COF showed significantly lower CO production rates, suggesting that crystallinity of the COF is beneficial to its photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction."

As one of the most abundant elements on earth, iron offers a level of sustainable and long‐term availability that is uncommon for most transition metals. Although iron is commonly found in the oxidation states of +2 and +3, the use of redox‐active ligands has allowed the synthesis and application of low oxidation state iron complexes in catalysis. A broad range of hydrofunctionalisation reactions have been developed by using iron catalysts in a wide variety of oxidation states. Intense development over the past decade has resulted in the development of iron‐catalysed hydroamination, hydroalkoxylation, hydrocarboxylation, hydrothiolation, hydrovinylation, hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydrophosphination, hydromagnesiation and carbonylation reactions, amongst others. With the field still in its infancy, there is great potential for further developments in the mechanistic understanding and synthetic and industrial applicability of these processes."

Despite the many successes obtained using modern functionals, care is still needed as quite large errors can occur. These can be best understood by taking into consideration how density functional theory works, and how well it performs for the simpler case of main-group compounds. This serves to highlight the critical role of the exchange functional, which describes such varied effects as electron self-interaction, static (or non-dynamic) correlation, and dynamic correlation. A poor balance between these effects can lead to significant errors even for main-group compounds. This is even truer for transition metal compounds. Benchmark data published in the last year suggest that all existing functionals can lead to severe errors for some transition metal compounds. There is a slight trend for systems involving more static correlation to be treated better using second- or third-generation gradient-corrected or kinetic energy density functionals, rather than hybrid functionals. This trend is however quite variable from one type of compound to another. Computed spin-state splittings are highly variable from one functional to another, and this is also diagnostic of differences in the extent of static correlation. The increasing awareness of transition metal compounds by the developers of new exchange–correlation functionals should lead in the medium term to more accurate and hence (even) more useful functionals."

All ionic liquids used in this study contained the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation; the anions were trifluoromethanesulfonate, methylsulfate, dimethylphosphate, dicyanamide, chloride and acetate. Using a protocol for assessing the ability to swell small wood blocks (10 × 10 × 5 mm), it was shown that the anion has a profound impact on the ability to promote both swelling and dissolution of biomass. Time course studies showed that viscosity, temperature and water content were also important parameters influencing the swelling process. We used Kamlet–Taft parameters to quantify the solvent polarity of the ionic liquids and found that the anion basicity described by the parameter β correlated with the ability to expand and dissolve pine lignocellulose. It is shown that 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide dissolves neither cellulose nor lignocellulosic material."

Many dyes have been tested for this purpose; however, no dye with significant absorption beyond 750 nm has functioned properly. We have examined a series of ruthenium phthalocyanines, a dye class with large and tunable absorption in the red. For these dyes we observe a large reduction in the output voltage of the cells relative to the benchmark dye (N719). By examination of photovoltage transients and charge density measurements, we demonstrate that this reduction in voltage is caused by a 100-fold increase in the rate constant for recombination (iodine reduction) at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. N719, however, does not seem to catalyze this reaction. By examination of the literature, we propose that catalysis of the recombination reaction may be occurring for many other classes of potentially useful dyes including porphyrins, coumarins, perylenes, cyanines, merocyanines, and azulene. This widespread ability of the dye to catalyze recombination has not been appreciated before. This finding has important implications for future work to improve the red response of dye sensitized photovoltaics."

However, the extreme sensitivity of [FeFe] hydrogenases to oxygen presents a major challenge for exploiting these organisms to achieve sustainable photosynthetic hydrogen production. In this study, the mechanism of oxygen inactivation of the [FeFe] hydrogenase Cr HydA1 from C. reinhardtii has been investigated. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that reaction with oxygen results in destruction of the [4Fe-4S] domain of the active site H-cluster while leaving the di-iron domain (2Fe H ) essentially intact. By protein film electrochemistry we were able to determine the order of events leading up to this destruction. Carbon monoxide, a competitive inhibitor of Cr HydA1 which binds to an Fe atom of the 2Fe H domain and is otherwise not known to attack FeS clusters in proteins, reacts nearly two orders of magnitude faster than oxygen and protects the enzyme against oxygen damage. These results therefore show that destruction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is initiated by binding and reduction of oxygen at the di-iron domain—a key step that is blocked by carbon monoxide. The relatively slow attack by oxygen compared to carbon monoxide suggests that a very high level of discrimination can be achieved by subtle factors such as electronic effects (specific orbital overlap requirements) and steric constraints at the active site."

Such polymers show microporosity and mesoporosity and exhibit Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of up to 1970 m2 g−1. The CO2 adsorption capacity of these polymers was evaluated using a thermogravimetric analyser (atmospheric pressure tests) and a high-pressure magnetic suspension balance (high pressure tests). CO2 capture capacities were related to the textural properties of the HCPs. The performance of these materials to adsorb CO2 at atmospheric pressure was characterized by maximum CO2 uptakes of 1.7 mmol g−1 (7.4 wt%) at 298 K. At higher pressures (30 bar), the polymers show CO2 uptakes of up to 13.4 mmol g−1 (59 wt%), superior to zeolite-based materials (zeolite 13X, zeolite NaX) and commercial activated carbons (BPL, Norit R). In addition, these polymers showed low isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption and good selectivity towards CO2.

Azoheteroarenes represent a relatively new but understudied type of photoswitch, where one of the aryl rings from the conventional azobenzene class has been replaced with a five-membered heteroaromatic ring. Initial studies have suggested the azoheteroarenes—the arylazopyrazoles in particular—to have excellent photoswitching properties (quantitative switching and long Z isomer half-life). Here we present a systematic computational and experimental study to elucidate the origin of the long thermal half-lives and excellent addressability of the arylazopyrazoles, and apply this understanding to determine important structure–property relationships for a wide array of comparable azoheteroaryl photoswitches. We identify compounds with Z isomer half-lives ranging from seconds to hours, to days and to years, and variable absorption characteristics, all through tuning of the heteraromatic ring. Conformation perhaps plays the largest role in determining such properties: the compounds with the longest isomerization half-lives adopt a T-shaped ground state Z isomer conformation and proceed through a T-shaped isomerization pathway, whereas the most complete photoswitching is achieved for compounds that have a twisted (rather than T-shaped) Z isomer conformation. By balancing these factors, we report a new azopyrazole 3pzH, which can be quantitatively switched to its Z isomer (>98%) with 355 nm irradiation, near-quantitatively (97%) switched back to the E isomer with 532 nm irradiation, and has a very long half-life for thermal isomerization (t1/2 = 74 d at 25 °C). Given the large tunability of their properties, the predictive nature of their performance, and the other functional opportunities afforded by usage of a heteroaromatic system, we believe the azoheteroaryl photoswitches to have huge potential in a wide range of optically addressable applications."

Owing to the strong aromatic C=N bond and high chemical stability, only a few CTFs are crystalline, and most CTFs are amorphous. Herein we report a new general strategy to give highly crystalline CTFs by in situ formation of aldehyde monomers through the controlled oxidation of alcohols. This general strategy allows a series of crystalline CTFs with different monomers to be prepared, which are shown to have higher thermal stability and enhanced performance in photocatalysis as compared with the less crystalline or amorphous CTFs. This open-system approach is very simple and convenient, which presents a potential pathway to large-scale industrial production of crystalline CTFs."

Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation has the potential to provide a green route for the synthesis of the majority of industrially important chemicals. The major limiting factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic organic synthesis is the lack of high selectivity; therefore, substantial effort has been devoted to solving this problem. Responding to this fast‐moving progress, this review gives an overview of the fundamental understanding of the reactive oxygen species involved in photocatalytic organic oxidations and furthermore, the general mechanisms of a few crucial oxidation reactions. The focus of this critical review is on the discussion of diverse strategies to improve the selectivity of high value chemicals, including band engineering, metal loading, hybrid materials, and defect engineering, with the primary aim of highlighting the catalyst design protocols based on the reaction mechanism. Finally, the difficulties and challenges of developing highly selective oxidation photocatalysts are comprehensively discussed in order to help direct the focus of future research."

Using small-wide angle x-ray scattering (SWAXS), three major diffraction peaks are found: two high- Q peaks that show little dependence on the alkyl chain length (n) and a low-Q peak that strongly depends both in amplitude and position on n. This low-Q peak is the signature of the occurrence of nanoscale structural heterogeneities whose sizes depend on the length of the alkyl chain and are related to chain segregation into nano-domains. Using optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy, we access intermolecular dynamic features that suggest that chain aggregation only occurs for n≥3, in agreement with the SWAXS data. Moreover, the increase in the frequency and width of the main band of the optical Kerr effect spectra in going from n = 2 to 3 is consistent with stiffening of the intermolecular potential due to chain segregation. Multicomponent line shape analysis suggests that there are least three modes that underlie the main band in the 0–200 cm−1 region of the optical Kerr effect spectra of these ionic liquids. Given the similarity of ionic liquids to other complex fluid systems, we assign the low-frequency component to a fast β-relaxation mode and the intermediate- and high-frequency components to librational modes."

In the present work, we use in situ X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopy to resolve the long-standing debate about surface species present in iridium-based catalysts during the OER. We find that the surface of an initially metallic iridium model electrode converts into a mixed-valent, conductive iridium oxide matrix during the OER, which contains OII- and electrophilic OI- species. We observe a positive correlation between the OI- concentration and the evolved oxygen, suggesting that these electrophilic oxygen sites may be involved in catalyzing the OER. We can understand this observation by analogy with photosystem II; their electrophilicity renders the OI- species active in O-O bond formation, i.e. the likely potential- and rate-determining step of the OER. The ability of amorphous iridium oxyhydroxides to easily host such reactive, electrophilic species can explain their superior performance when compared to plain iridium metal or crystalline rutile-type IrO2."

Highly crystalline layered ternary sulfide copper-molybdenum-sulfide (Cu2MoS4) was prepared by a simple precipitation method from CuI and [MoS4]2− precursors. In aqueous solution and over a wide pH range (pH 0 to 7), this Cu2MoS4 showed very good catalytic activity for HER with an overvoltage requirement of only ca. 135 mV and an apparent exchange current density of 0.040 mA cm−2 (Tafel slope of ca. 95 mV per decade was found irrespective of the pH value). This Cu2MoS4 catalyst was found to be stable during electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Therefore, it represents an attractive alternative to platinum."

By replacing the C-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin (Ub) with an alkyne functionality, a selective reaction with the active-site cysteine residue of de-ubiquitinating enzymes was observed. The resulting product was shown to be a quaternary vinyl thioether, as determined by X-ray crystallography. Proteomic analysis of proteins bound to an immobilized Ub alkyne probe confirmed the selectivity toward de-ubiquitinating enzymes.

The water oxidation half-reaction typically proceeds with poor efficiency and produces the unprofitable and often damaging product, O2. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach and couple solar H2 generation with value-added organic substrate oxidation. Solar irradiation of a cyanamide surface-functionalized melon-type carbon nitride ((NCN)CNx) and a molecular nickel(II) bis(diphosphine) H2-evolution catalyst (NiP) enabled the production of H2 with concomitant selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes in high yield under purely aqueous conditions, at room temperature and ambient pressure. This one-pot system maintained its activity over 24 h, generating products in 1:1 stoichiometry, separated in the gas and solution phases. The (NCN)CNx-NiP system showed an activity of 763 μmol (g CNx)(-1) h(-1) toward H2 and aldehyde production, a Ni-based turnover frequency of 76 h(-1), and an external quantum efficiency of 15% (λ = 360 ± 10 nm). This precious metal-free and nontoxic photocatalytic system displays better performance than an analogous system containing platinum instead of NiP. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the photoactivity of (NCN)CNx is due to efficient substrate oxidation of the material, which outweighs possible charge recombination compared to the nonfunctionalized melon-type carbon nitride. Photoexcited (NCN)CNx in the presence of an organic substrate can accumulate ultralong-lived ""trapped electrons"", which allow for fuel generation in the dark. The artificial photosynthetic system thereby catalyzes a closed redox cycle showing 100% atom economy and generates two value-added products, a solar chemical, and solar fuel."

However, beyond basic considerations such as spectral absorption, the factors that dictate their photocatalytic activity are poorly understood. Here we investigate a series of linear conjugated polymers with external quantum efficiencies for hydrogen production between 0.4 and 11.6%. We monitor the generation of the photoactive species from femtoseconds to seconds after light absorption using transient spectroscopy and correlate their yield with the measured photocatalytic activity. Experiments coupled with modeling suggest that the localization of water around the polymer chain due to the incorporation of sulfone groups into an otherwise hydrophobic backbone is crucial for charge generation. Calculations of solution redox potentials and charge transfer free energies demonstrate that electron transfer from the sacrificial donor becomes thermodynamically favored as a result of the more polar local environment, leading to the production of long-lived electrons in these amphiphilic polymers."

Compounds such as Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 exhibit a capacity to store charge in excess of the transition metal redox reactions. The additional capacity occurs at and above 4.5 V versus Li+/Li. The capacity at 4.5 V is dominated by oxidation of the O2– anions accounting for ∼0.43 e–/formula unit, with an additional 0.06 e–/formula unit being associated with O loss from the lattice. In contrast, the capacity above 4.5 V is mainly O loss, ∼0.08 e–/formula. The O redox reaction involves the formation of localized hole states on O during charge, which are located on O coordinated by (Mn4+/Li+). The results have been obtained by combining operando electrochemical mass spec on 18O labeled Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 with XANES, soft X-ray spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.

More reversible chemistry can improve crystallinity 6–9 , but this typically yields COFs with poor physicochemical stability and limited application scope 5 . Here we report a general and scalable protocol to prepare robust, highly crystalline imine COFs, based on an unexpected framework reconstruction. In contrast to standard approaches in which monomers are initially randomly aligned, our method involves the pre-organization of monomers using a reversible and removable covalent tether, followed by confined polymerization. This reconstruction route produces reconstructed COFs with greatly enhanced crystallinity and much higher porosity by means of a simple vacuum-free synthetic procedure. The increased crystallinity in the reconstructed COFs improves charge carrier transport, leading to sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of up to 27.98 mmol h −1 g −1 . This nanoconfinement-assisted reconstruction strategy is a step towards programming function in organic materials through atomistic structural control."

Nano-particles that bind monovalently to a target surface do not discriminate sharply between surfaces with high and low receptor coverage. In contrast, “multivalent” nano-particles that can bind to a larger number of ligands simultaneously, display regimes of “super selectivity” where the fraction of bound particles varies sharply with the receptor concentration. We present numerical simulations that show that multivalent nano-particles can be designed such that they approach the “on-off” binding behavior ideal for receptor-concentration selective targeting. We propose a simple analytical model that accounts for the super selective behavior of multivalent nano-particles. The model shows that the super selectivity is due to the fact that the number of distinct ligand-receptor binding arrangements increases in a highly nonlinear way with receptor coverage. Somewhat counterintuitively, our study shows that selectivity can be improved by making the individual ligand-receptor bonds weaker. We propose a simple rule of thumb to predict the conditions under which super selectivity can be achieved. We validate our model predictions against the Monte Carlo simulations."

Despite the potential utility of sulfur dioxide based reactions, delivering products such as sulfones, sulfonamides and sulfinic acids, the number of examples of these reactions being exploited in synthesis is arguably lower than would be expected. One significant contributing factor to this is undoubtedly the toxic and gaseous nature of SO 2 . One strategy to overcome this limitation is to employ an equivalent, or surrogate, so that the gaseous reagent is no longer needed. This strategy has proven to be a success, with a number of methods being described. The reactions reported include variants of traditional reactions in which the gaseous reagent has been replaced with a surrogate, and also new transformations for which no gaseous reaction is known.

Pd0-resins can be carefully implanted in the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos and display excellent biocompatibility and local catalytic activity. The in vitro efficacy shown by this masking/activation strategy underlines its potential to develop a bioorthogonally activated prodrug approach and supports further in vivo investigations.

Understanding how the synthesis method, carrier properties, and metal identity impact the isolation of metal centers is essential to guide their design. This study compares the effectiveness of direct and postsynthetic routes to prepare SAHCs by incorporating palladium, silver, iridium, platinum, or gold in g‐C 3 N 4 of distinct morphology (bulk, mesoporous and exfoliated). The speciation (single atoms, dimers, clusters, or nanoparticles), distribution, and oxidation state of the supported metals are characterized by multiple techniques including extensive use of aberration‐corrected electron microscopy. SAHCs are most readily attained via direct approaches applying copolymerizable metal precursors and employing high surface area carriers. In contrast, although post‐synthetic routes enable improved control over the metal loading, nanoparticle formation is more prevalent. Comparison of the carrier morphologies also points toward the involvement of defects in stabilizing single atoms. The distinct metal dispersions are rationalized by density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, highlighting the interplay between the adsorption energetics and diffusion kinetics. Evaluation in the continuous three‐phase semihydrogenation of 1‐hexyne identifies controlling the metal–carrier interaction and exposing the metal sites at the surface layer as key challenges in designing efficient SAHCs."

This paper introduces a systematic survey, ""Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS)"" of the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The survey covers the full frequency range from 329 to 363 GHz (0.8 mm) with additional targeted observations at 3.0 and 1.3 mm. More than 10,000 features are detected toward one component in the protostellar binary. Glycolaldehyde, its isomers, methyl formate and acetic acid, and its reduced alcohol, ethylene glycol, are clearly detected. For ethylene glycol both lowest state conformers, aGg' and gGg', are detected, the latter for the first time in the ISM. The abundance of glycolaldehyde is comparable to or slightly larger than that of ethylene glycol. In comparison to the Galactic Center, these two species are over-abundant relative to methanol, possibly an indication of formation at low temperatures in CO-rich ices. Both 13C and deuterated isotopologues of glycolaldehyde are detected, also for the first time ever in the ISM. For the deuterated species, a D/H ratio of approximately 5% is found with no differences between the deuteration in the different functional groups of glycolaldehyde. Measurements of the 13C-species lead to a 12C:13C ratio of approximately 30, lower than the typical ISM value. This low ratio may reflect an enhancement of 13CO in the ice due to either ion-molecule reactions in the gas before freeze-out or differences in the temperatures where 12CO and 13CO ices sublimate. The results reinforce the importance of low-temperature grain surface chemistry for the formation of prebiotic molecules seen here in the gas after sublimation of the entire ice mantle."

The methods reported are useful for the site-specific labeling of recombinant proteins and may be combined with mutually orthogonal methods of introducing unnatural amino acids into proteins as well as with chemically orthogonal methods of protein labeling. This should allow the site specific incorporation of multiple distinct probes into proteins and the control of protein topology and structure by intramolecular orthogonal conjugation reactions."

We report herein a rate law analysis of the order of water oxidation as a function of surface hole density on a hematite photoanode employing photoinduced absorption spectroscopy. Our study reveals a transition from a slow, first order reaction at low accumulated hole density to a faster, third order mechanism once the surface hole density is sufficient to enable the oxidation of nearest neighbor metal atoms. This study thus provides direct evidence for the multihole catalysis of water oxidation by hematite, and demonstrates the hole accumulation level required to achieve this, leading to key insights both for reaction mechanism and strategies to enhance function."

The unprecedented ability of these iridium complexes to generate H 2 O 2 by catalytic hydride transfer from the coenzyme NADH to oxygen is demonstrated. Such organoiridium complexes are promising as a new generation of anticancer drugs for effective oxidant therapy."

Due to the highly functionalized nature of glycerol, it is an important biochemical that can be utilized as a platform chemical for the production of high-added-value products. At present, research groups in academia and industry are exploring potential direct processes for the synthesis of useful potential chemicals using catalytic processes. Over the last 10 years, there has been huge development of potential catalytic processes using glycerol as the platform chemical. One of the most common processes investigated so far is the catalytic oxidation of glycerol at mild conditions for the formation of valuable oxygenated compounds used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. The major challenges associated with the selective oxidation of glycerol are (i) the control of selectivity to the desired products, (ii) high activity and resistance to poisoning, and (iii) minimizing the usage of alkaline conditions. To address these challenges, the most common catalysts used for the oxidation of glycerol are based on supported metal nanoparticles. The first significant breakthrough was the successful utilization of supported gold nanoparticles for improving the selectivity to specific products, and the second was the utilization of supported bimetallic nanoparticles based on gold, palladium, and platinum for improving activity and controlling the selectivity to the desired products. Moreover, the utilization of base-free reaction conditions for the catalytic oxidation of glycerol has unlocked new pathways for the production of free-base products, which facilitates potential industrial application. The advantages of using gold-based catalysts are the improvement of the catalyst lifetime, stability, and reusability, which are key factors for potential commercialization. In this Account, we discuss the advantages of the using supported gold-based nanoparticles, preparation methods for achieving highly active gold-based catalysts, and parameters such as particle size, morphology of the bimetallic particle, and metal-support interactions, which can influence activity and selectivity to the desired products."

In this work, for the first time, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanodots have been synthesized by ionic liquid assisted grinding exfoliation of bulk platelets and isolated by sequential centrifugation. The nanodots have a thickness of up to 7 layers (∼4 nm) and an average lateral size smaller than 20 nm. Detailed structural characterization established that the nanodots retained the crystalline quality and low oxidation states of the bulk material. The small lateral size and reduced number of layers provided these nanodots with an easier path for the electron transport and plentiful active sites for the catalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic electrolyte. The MoS2 nanodots exhibited good durability and a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec–1 with an estimated onset potential of −0.09 V vs RHE, which are considered among the best values achieved for 2H phase. It is envisaged that this work may provide a simplistic route to synthesize a wide range of 2D layered nanodots that have applications in water splitting and other energy related technologies."

The key step in this process is to allow full disproportionation of CuBr/Me6TREN (TREN = tris(dimethylamino)ethyl amine to Cu(0) powder and CuBr2 in water prior to addition of both monomer and initiator. This provides an extremely powerful tool for the synthesis of functional water-soluble polymers with controlled chain length and narrow molecular weight distributions (polydispersity index approximately 1.10), including poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), N,N-dimethylacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), and an acrylamido glyco monomer. The polymerizations are performed at or below ambient temperature with quantitative conversions attained in minutes. Polymers have high chain end fidelity capable of undergoing chain extensions to full conversion or multiblock copolymerization via iterative monomer addition after full conversion. Activator generated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide in water was also conducted as a comparison with the SET-LRP system. This shows that the addition sequence of l-ascorbic acid is crucial in determining the onset of disproportionation, or otherwise. Finally, this robust technique was applied to polymerizations under biologically relevant conditions (PBS buffer) and a complex ethanol/water mixture (tequila)."

The key to a rational catalyst design is understanding the descriptors that govern the alkaline HER activity. Unfortunately, the principles that govern the alkaline HER performance remain unclear and are still under debate. By studying the alkaline HER at a series of NiCu bimetallic surfaces, where the electronic structure is modulated by the ligand effect, we demonstrate that alkaline HER activity can be correlated with either the calculated or the experimental-measured d band center (an indicator of hydrogen binding energy) via a volcano-type relationship. Such correlation indicates the descriptor role of the d band center, and this hypothesis is further supported by the evidence that combining Ni and Cu produces a variety of adsorption sites, which possess near-optimal hydrogen binding energy. Our finding broadens the applicability of d band theory to activity prediction of metal electrocatalysts and may offer an insightful understanding of alkaline HER mechanism."

However, the single-atoms loading amount is always within 0.5% in most of the reported due to the agglomeration at higher loading concentrations. In this work, the highly dispersed and large loading amount (&gt;1 wt%) of copper single-atoms were achieved on TiO 2 , exhibiting the H 2 evolution rate of 101.7 mmol g −1 h −1 under simulated solar light irradiation, which is higher than other photocatalysts reported, in addition to the excellent stability as proved after storing 380 days. More importantly, it exhibits an apparent quantum efficiency of 56% at 365 nm, a significant breakthrough in this field. The highly dispersed and large amount of Cu single-atoms incorporation on TiO 2 enables the efficient electron transfer via Cu 2+ -Cu + process.

The oxidation capacity of the highly polluted urban area of Santiago, Chile has been evaluated during a summer measurement campaign carried out from 8–20 March 2005. The hydroxyl (OH) radical budget was evaluated employing a simple quasi-photostationary-state model (PSS) constrained with simultaneous measurements of HONO, HCHO, O3, NO, NO2, j(O1D), j(NO2), 13 alkenes and meteorological parameters. In addition, a zero dimensional photochemical box model based on the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCMv3.1) has been used to estimate production rates and total free radical budgets, including OH, HO2 and RO2. Besides the above parameters, the MCM model has been constrained by the measured CO and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including alkanes and aromatics. Both models simulate the same OH concentration during daytime indicating that the primary OH sources and sinks included in the simple PSS model predominate. Mixing ratios of the main OH radical precursors were found to be in the range 0.8–7 ppbv (HONO), 0.9–11 ppbv (HCHO) and 0–125 ppbv (O3). The alkenes average mixing ratio was ~58 ppbC accounting for ~12% of the total identified non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). During the daytime (08:00 h–19:00 h), HONO photolysis was shown to be the most important primary OH radical source comprising alone ~55% of the total initial production rate, followed by alkene ozonolysis (~24%) and photolysis of HCHO (~16%) and O3 (~5%). The calculated average and maximum daytime OH production rates from HONO photolysis was 1.7 ppbv h−1 and 3.1 ppbv h−1, respectively. Based on the experimental results a strong photochemical daytime source of HONO is proposed. A detailed analysis of the sources of OH radical precursors has also been carried out."

We found the viscosity of 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C2C1C1Im][Tf2N], for example, to be about three times higher than that of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C2C1Im][Tf2N]. In order to explain these macroscopic changes upon methylation we investigated the vibrational as well as the magnetic resonance structure of [Tf2N]− salts involving the cations 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium [C2C1Im]+, 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium [C2C1C1Im]+, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [C4C1Im]+, and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium [C4C1C1Im]+ by means of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and 13C NMR as well as 1H NMR spectroscopy aiming a better microscopic understanding of the cation–anion interaction. To reveal the impact of methylating the C2 position and changing the alkyl side chain length of the imidazolium a detailed assignment of the individual peaks is followed by a comparative discussion of the spectral features also considering already published work. Our spectroscopic findings deduce electron density changes leading to changes in the position and strength of interionic interactions and reduced configurational variations. Both facts are represented on a macroscopic level by the viscosity and melting point. Therefore changes on a macroscopic level clearly express molecular alterations which in turn can be observed using spectroscopic methods as Raman, IR and NMR."

In particular, with the Ru-dye as visible light photosensitizer, hierarchical Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays-graphene (Ni(OH)2-GR) composites exhibit superior photoactivity and selectivity, which remarkably surpass other counterparts and most of analogous hybrid photocatalyst system. The origin of such superior performance of Ni(OH)2-GR is attributed to its appropriate synergy on the enhanced adsorption of CO2, increased active sites for CO2 reduction and improved charge carriers separation/transfer.

In total, 76 conjugated polymers were synthesized, including 60 crystalline COFs of which 18 were previously unreported. These COFs were then screened for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production using water and oxygen. One of these COFs, sonoCOF-F2, was found to be an excellent photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2O2 production even in the absence of sacrificial donors. However, after long-term photocatalytic tests (96 h), the imine sonoCOF-F2 transformed into an amide-linked COF with reduced crystallinity and loss of electronic conjugation, decreasing the photocatalytic activity. When benzyl alcohol was introduced to form a two-phase catalytic system, the photostability of sonoCOF-F2 was greatly enhanced, leading to stable H2O2 production for at least 1 week."

The amphiphilic hybrid molecules can slowly assemble into membrane-like vesicles by using the POM clusters as polar head groups, as studied by laser light scattering and TEM techniques. The hollow vesicles have a typical bilayer structure with the hydrophilic Mn-Anderson cluster facing outside and long hydrophobic alkyl chains staying inside to form the solvent-phobic layer. Due to the rigidity of the POM polar heads, the two alkyl tails have to bend significantly for the vesicle formation, which makes the vesicle formation more difficult compared to some conventional surfactants. This is the first example of using hydrophilic POM macroions as polar head groups for a surfactant system."

Cisplatin acts by binding to DNA and forming 1,2 intrastrand cross-links. Its importance is reflected by the fact that it is estimated that 50-70 % of cancer patients are treated with a platinum drug [7]. For some time, molecular designs in the metallo-drug field remained obdurately anchored in cis -diamine platinum(II) chemistry, but now the field is evolving rapidly with a variety of alternate and very diverse designs being explored. These designs give rise to new spectra of activity and potency and can circumvent cisplatin resistance. This critical review considers the existing clinical platinum drugs, and those currently in commercial development, alongside the new designs including ruthenium anticancer and antimetastatic drugs in clinical trials, polynuclear drugs, organometallic drugs, titanium and gallium drugs, and emerging supramolecular metallo-drugs that act on DNA by noncovalent interactions. The rapid evolution of the field is being informed by post-genomic knowledge and approaches, and further dramatic step-change breakthroughs can be expected as a result; harnessing this knowledge and responding to and taking advantage of this new environment requires integration of chemistry and biology research."

In this study, liquid fuels and chemicals (e.g., acetic acid, methanol, ethanol, and formaldehyde) were synthesized in a one‐step process from CO 2 and CH 4 at room temperature (30 °C) and atmospheric pressure for the first time by using a novel plasma reactor with a water electrode. The total selectivity to oxygenates was approximately 50–60 %, with acetic acid being the major component at 40.2 % selectivity, the highest value reported for acetic acid thus far. Interestingly, the direct plasma synthesis of acetic acid from CH 4 and CO 2 is an ideal reaction with 100 % atom economy, but it is almost impossible by thermal catalysis owing to the significant thermodynamic barrier. The combination of plasma and catalyst in this process shows great potential for manipulating the distribution of liquid chemical products in a given process."

These enzymes have broad specificity, are relatively stable, and have been made available in large quantities by using conventional genetic methods. The catalytic cycle comprises two half‐reactions: reduction of flavin mononucleotide by NAD(P)H followed by flavin oxidation through stereospecific reduction of the CC bond of a wide range of activated alkenes. Recent years have witnessed extensive investigation of these reactions, aided by knowledge of atomic resolution structures for selected family members. In turn, this has led to deep understanding of the stereochemical course of substrate reduction and expansion of the biocatalytic versatility of this enzyme family through engineering approaches. We provide an overview of the structures, mechanisms, and chemical specificity of the reactions catalyzed by the OYE members. We provide an overview of the biocatalytic potential of this family of enzymes and illustrate the value of combining mechanistic and structural studies of biocatalysts to guide future exploitation of these enzymes in industrial biocatalysis."

Complex 1 is remarkably stable in the dark, even in the presence of cellular reducing agents such as glutathione, but readily undergoes photoinduced ligand substitution and photoreduction reactions. When 1 is photoactivated in cells, it is highly toxic: 13-80 x more cytotoxic than the Pt(II) anticancer drug cisplatin, and ca. 15 x more cytotoxic toward cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells. Cisplatin targets DNA, and DNA platination levels induced in HaCaT skin cells by 1 were similar to those of cisplatin. However, cisplatin forms mainly intrastrand cis diguanine cross-links on DNA between neighboring nucleotides, whereas photoactivated complex 1 rapidly forms unusual trans azido/guanine, and then trans diguanine Pt(II) adducts, which are probably mainly intrastrand cross-links between two guanines separated by a third base. DNA interstrand and DNA-protein cross-links were also detected. Importantly, DNA repair synthesis on plasmid DNA platinated by photoactivated 1 was markedly lower than for cisplatin or its isomer transplatin (an inactive complex). Single-cell electrophoresis experiments also demonstrated that the DNA damage is different from that induced by cisplatin or transplatin. Cell death is not solely dependent on activation of the caspase 3 pathway, and, in contrast to cisplatin, p53 protein did not accumulate in cells after photosensitization of 1. The trans diazido Pt(IV) complex 1 therefore has remarkable properties and is a candidate for use in photoactivated cancer chemotherapy."

However, being atomically thin limits their optical absorption or emission. Hence, enhancing their photoluminescence by plasmonic nanostructures is critical for integrating these materials in optoelectronic and photonic devices. Typical photoluminescence enhancement from transition metal dichalcogenides is 100-fold, with recent enhancement of 1,000-fold achieved by simultaneously enhancing absorption, emission and directionality of the system. By suspending WSe 2 flakes onto sub-20-nm-wide trenches in gold substrate, we report a giant photoluminescence enhancement of ∼20,000-fold. It is attributed to an enhanced absorption of the pump laser due to the lateral gap plasmons confined in the trenches and the enhanced Purcell factor by the plasmonic nanostructure. This work demonstrates the feasibility of giant photoluminescence enhancement in WSe 2 with judiciously designed plasmonic nanostructures and paves a way towards the implementation of plasmon-enhanced transition metal dichalcogenide photodetectors, sensors and emitters."

The electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions and corrosion resistance under both acidic and alkaline conditions were examined for all these catalysts and compared to those for the benchmark catalysts Pt/C (HER/ORR) and IrO2 (OER). The highest activities were found in alkaline solutions for Co2P for HER and ORR and Ni2P for OER. Good activity was also found in acid for some of these reactions, although the catalysts suffered from susceptibility to corrosion. Co2P was further studied in an alkaline environment, as it shows high catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without significant hysteresis. The onset potential (at 0.5 mA cm–2) obtained was 0.8 V vs RHE, and a Tafel slope value of 38 mV dec–1 was found with a maximum kinetic mass activity of 2870 A gCo–1 at 0.7 V vs RHE. Utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, it is possible to observe high-surface-area needle-like single-crystal cobalt oxide structures on the surface of the Co2P particles at the beginning of the ORR. Hence the high rates of initial corrosion of the Co2P appear to be associated with the dissolution and precipitation of cobalt oxide on the particle surface. The as-synthesized Co2P/C also shows good performance in an 8-h stability test for the OER, carried out at 1.6 V vs RHE in alkaline conditions, with negligible drop in current density over time. Interestingly, in an acidic environment the catalyst is very active toward two-electron oxygen reduction, leading to H2O2 with high selectivity (85%). It is intriguing that the pH dependence of this catalyst toward the ORR is similar to that seen for gold."

Typically transition metal oxides may be classified as noble transition metal oxides which exhibit excellent capacitive properties but have the drawback of generally being relatively expensive. Alternatively base metal oxides may also be utilised which are considerably cheaper and more environment friendly than noble transition metals as well as exhibiting good capacitive properties. In considering that nanostructured materials can help ameliorate the electrochemical performances of transition metal oxides, this review summarizes the recent investigations of fundamental advances in understanding the electrochemical reactivity of transition metal oxides, thus leading to an improved capacitive performance, which is essential for their continual use in a plethora of supercapacitor applications."

Precise control of the composition and structure of the metal nanoparticle cocatalysts is essential, and we show that fine-tuning the Au-Pd nanoparticle structure modifies the electronic properties of the cocatalyst significantly. Specifically, Pd(shell)-Au(core) nanoparticles immobilized on TiO2 exhibit extremely high quantum efficiencies for H2 production using a wide range of alcohols, implying that chemical byproducts from the biorefinery industry can be used as feedstocks. In addition, the excellent recyclability of our photocatalyst material indicates a high potential in industrial applications. We demonstrate that this particular elemental segregation provides optimal positioning of the unoccupied d-orbital states, which results in an enhanced utilization of the photoexcited electrons in redox reactions. We consider that the enhanced activity observed on TiO2 is generic in nature and can be transferred to other narrow band gap semiconductor supports for visible light photocatalysis."

To date, the best performing ILs are derived from nonrenewable sources such as petroleum or natural gas. Due to their potential for large-scale deployment, ILs derived from inexpensive, renewable reagents are highly desirable. Herein, we describe a process for synthesizing ILs from materials derived from lignin and hemicellulose, major components of terrestrial plant biomass. With respect to overall sugar yield, experimental evaluation of these compounds showed that they perform comparably to traditional ILs in biomass pretreatment."

Uniform NaYF 4 :Yb/Er UCNPs are first crafted by employing rationally designed double hydrophilic star‐like poly(acrylic acid)‐ block ‐poly(ethylene oxide) (PAA‐b‐PEO) diblock copolymer as nanoreactor, imparting the solubility of UCNPs and the tunability of film porosity during the manufacturing process. The subsequent incorporation of NaYF 4 :Yb/Er UCNPs as the mesoporous electrode led to a high efficiency of 17.8 %, which was further increased to 18.1 % upon NIR irradiation. The in situ integration of upconversion materials as functional components of perovskite solar cells offers the expanded flexibility for engineering the device architecture and broadening the solar spectral use."

The specific surfaces considered resemble the 100 and 111 faces of platinum. Several results emerge that should apply generally, not just to platinum. These results are generic consequences of water molecules binding strongly to surfaces that are incommensurate with favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns. We show that adlayers of water under these conditions have frustrated structures that interact unfavorably with adjacent liquid water. We elucidate dynamical processes of water in these cases that extend over a broad range of timescales, from less than picoseconds to more than nanoseconds. Associated spatial correlations extend over nanometers. We show that adlayer reorganization occurs intermittently, and each reorganization event correlates motions of several molecules. We show that soft liquid interfaces form adjacent to the adlayer, as is generally characteristic of liquid water adjacent to a hydrophobic surface. The infrequent adlayer reorganization produces a hydrophobic heterogeneity that we characterize by studying the degrees by which different regions of the adlayers attract small hydrophobic particles. Consequences for electrochemistry are discussed in the context of hydronium ions being attracted from the liquid to the metal–adlayer surface."

Hydrogen production via formic acid decomposition is often based on using supported catalysts with Pt-group metal nanoparticles. In the present paper, we show that the decomposition of the acid proceeds more rapidly on single metal atoms (by up to 1 order of magnitude). These atoms can be obtained by rather simple means through anchoring Pt-group metals onto mesoporous N-functionalized carbon nanofibers. A thorough evaluation of the structure of the active site by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ac-STEM) in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode and by CO chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quantum-chemical calculations reveals that the metal atom is coordinated by a pair of pyridinic nitrogen atoms at the edge of graphene sheets. The chelate binding provides an ionic/electron-deficient state of these atoms that prevents their aggregation and thereby leads to an excellent stability under the reaction conditions. Catalysts with single atoms have also shown very high selectivity. Evidently, the findings can be extended to hydrogen production from other chemicals and can be helpful for improving other energy-related and environmentally benign catalytic processes."

In support of this suggestion, both the expected borane dithiocarbonate product and an unexpected borane xanthate product have now been isolated. These are the first NHC-boranes with boron−sulfur bonds, and their structures have been secured by spectroscopic and crystallographic means. The first rate constants for H-atom transfer from an NHC borane complex were determined by using the ring opening of a substituted cyclobutylcarbinyl radical as a clock reaction. The rate constant for reaction of the NHC-borane with a secondary alkyl radical at ambient temperature is 4 × 104 M−1 s−1, and the Arrhenius function displayed an entropic term (log A term) that was typical for a bimolecular reaction. The B−H bond dissociation energy of an NHC-borane complex has been estimated at 88 kcal/mol. The putative NHC-boryl radical in these transformations has been detected by EPR spectroscopy.

Previous attempts to synthesize solids with large ordered mesopores by hard templating focused on the preparation of templates with thick walls (the thick walls become the pores in the target materials), something that has proved difficult to achieve. Here the large pores (11 nm) do not depend on the synthesis of a template with thick walls but instead on controlling the microporous bridging between the two sets of mesopores in the KIT-6 template. Such control determines the relative proportion of the two pore sizes. The wall thickness of the 3D cubic NiO mesopore has also been varied. Preliminary magnetic characterization indicates the freezing of uncompensated moments or blocking of superparamagnetism."

For films thinner than approximately 2 nm oscillatory structural forces are observed as the surface separation decreases and pairs of ion layers are squeezed out of the film. Strikingly, measurements of the shear stress of the ionic liquid film reveal low friction coefficients which are 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than for analogous films of non-polar molecular liquids, including standard hydrocarbon lubricants, up to ca. 1 MPa pressure. We attribute this to the geometric and charge characteristics of the ionic liquid: the irregular shapes of the ions lead to a low shear stress, while the strong coulombic interactions between the ions and the charged confining surfaces lead to a robust film which is maintained between the shearing surfaces when pressure is applied across the film."

Thin films of supported Cu catalysts are deposited on RDE tips following a procedure well-established in the fuel cell community. Lead (Pb) underpotential deposition (UPD) is used to determine the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of thin films of 40 wt % Cu/VC, 20 wt % Cu/SWNT, 50 wt % Cu/KB, and commercial 20 wt % Cu/VC catalysts on glassy carbon electrodes. Faradaic efficiencies of four carbon-supported Cu catalysts toward CO2 electroreduction to hydrocarbons are compared to that of electrodeposited smooth Cu films. For all the catalysts studied, the only hydrocarbons detected by GC are CH4 and C2H4. The Cu nanoparticles are found to be more active toward C2H4 generation versus electrodeposited smooth copper films. For the supported Cu nanocatalysts, the ratio of C2H4/CH4 Faradaic efficiencies is believed to be a function of particle size, as higher ratios are observed for smaller Cu nanoparticles. This is likely due to an increase in the fraction of under-coordinated sites, such as corners, edges, and defects, as the nanoparticles become smaller."

The analogous reaction with ammonia-borane, NH(3)·BH(3) (4), gave an insoluble product, [NH(2)-BH(2)](n) (8d), but copolymerization with MeNH(2)·BH(3) gave soluble random copolymers, [MeNH-BH(2)](n)-r-[NH(2)-BH(2)](m) (8b and 8c). The structures of polyaminoborane 8a and copolymers 8b and 8c were further analyzed by ultrahigh resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and 8a, together with insoluble homopolymer 8d, was also characterized by (11)B and (1)H solid-state NMR, IR, and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The data indicate that 8a-8c are essentially linear, high molecular weight materials and that the insoluble polyaminoborane 8d possesses a similar structure but is of lower molecular weight (ca. 20 repeat units), presumably due to premature precipitation during its formation. The yield and molecular weight of polymer 8a was found to be relatively robust toward the influence of different temperatures, solvents, and adduct concentrations, while higher catalyst loadings led to higher molecular weight materials. It was therefore unexpected that the polymerization of 7 using 5 was found to be a chain-growth rather than a step-growth process, where high molecular weights were already attained at about 40% conversion of 7. The results obtained are consistent with a two stage polymerization mechanism where, first, the Ir catalyst 5 dehydrogenates 7 to afford the monomer MeNH═BH(2) and, second, the same catalyst effects the subsequent polymerization of this species. A wide range of other catalysts based on Ru, Rh, and Pd were also found to be effective for the transformation of 7 to polyaminoborane 8a. For example, polyaminoborane 8a was even isolated from the initial stage of the dehydrocoupling/dehydrogenation of 7 with [Rh(μ-Cl)(1,5-cod)](2) (2) as the catalyst at 20 °C, a reaction reported to give the N,N,N-trimethyl borazine, [MeN-BH](3), under different conditions (dimethoxyethane, 45 °C). The ability to use a variety of catalysts to prepare polyaminoboranes suggests that the synthetic strategy should be applicable to a broad range of amine-borane precursors and is a promising development for this new class of inorganic polymers."

However, there has been little conclusive experimental evidence for the existence of intermediate mesoscopic structure between the first/second shell correlations shown by neutron scattering on short chain length based materials and the mesophase structure of the long chain length ionic liquid crystals. Herein, small angle neutron scattering measurements have been performed on selectively H/D-isotopically substituted 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquids with butyl, hexyl, and octyl substituents. The data show the unambiguous existence of a diffraction peak in the low-Q region for all three liquids which moves to longer distances (lower Q), sharpens, and increases in intensity with increasing length of the alkyl substituent. It is notable, however, that this peak occurs at lower values of Q (longer length scale) than predicted in any of the previously published MD simulations of ionic liquids, and that the magnitude of the scattering from this peak is comparable with that from the remainder of the amorphous ionic liquid. This strongly suggests that the peak arises from the second coordination shells of the ions along the vector of alkyl-chain substituents as a consequence of increasing the anisotropy of the cation, and that there is little or no long-range correlated nanostructure in these ionic liquids."

The TiO2/graphene composites display high performance as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), such as having high reversible lithium storage capacity, high Coulombic efficiency, excellent cycling stability, and high rate capability. The excellent electrochemical performance and special structure of the composites thus offer a way to prepare novel graphene-based electrode materials for high-energy-density and high-power LIBs.
